Given the clarified root cause that the vulnerability stems from the `readBytes` function not ensuring the parsed password is null-terminated, leading to a potential buffer over-read, the specific SWF field related to this CVE is the "Protect" tag's password field.

In SWF files, the "Protect" tag is used to prevent unauthorized viewing and editing of the file's content. If a password is provided with the Protect tag, it is used to enable the protection. The CVE-2016-9827 vulnerability arises when parsing the Protect tag's password due to the function's failure to ensure the password string read from the SWF file is null-terminated, which can be exploited through a specially crafted SWF file to cause a denial of service (buffer over-read).

The patch addresses this issue by changing how the password is readâ€”instead of using `readBytes` to read a specified number of bytes (which could then be mishandled due to the lack of null-termination), it uses `readString`, which inherently ensures the string is properly null-terminated. This directly impacts how the Protect tag's password is handled and mitigates the risk associated with buffer over-read in this context.
