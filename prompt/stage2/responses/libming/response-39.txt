Based on the information previously discussed and the clarification provided, the root cause of CVE-2016-9827 is indeed related to the function `readBytes` not ensuring that the parsed password (associated with a Protect tag in an SWF file) is null-terminated when reading it from a crafted SWF file. This oversight can lead to a buffer over-read issue because the consuming function might continue reading past the end of the allocated buffer, expecting to find a null terminator that denotes the end of a string.

Given this clarification, the field in SWF that is directly related to invoking this CVE is the "Password" field within the Protect tag. The Protect tag is used to indicate that an SWF file is protected, potentially requiring a password to allow modifications. In the case of this vulnerability, when processing SWF files containing a Protect tag, the incorrect handling of the Password field—due to relying on `readBytes` without proper null termination—exposes the application to a possible denial of service (DoS) attack through a buffer over-read vulnerability. 

The patch changes the reading mechanism for this Password from directly reading a specified number of bytes (which then lacks proper null termination) to utilizing `readString`, which inherently ensures the reading process stops at a null terminator, mitigating the risk of reading beyond the allocated buffer.
