Based on the given information and the specifics of the patch, the CVE-2016-9827 vulnerability is closely associated with the processing of the Protect tag in SWF files. The Protect tag in SWF (Shockwave Flash) files is used to add a simple form of protection to the files, often by setting a password that restricts editing or viewing the ActionScript or other content within the SWF file. 

In the context of this vulnerability, when the Protect tag is processed, the original implementation used `readBytes` to read the password data associated with this tag. This method does not ensure that the parsed password is null-terminated, leading to a potential buffer over-read if the function attempts to read beyond the actual data length. This kind of vulnerability can lead to a denial of service (DoS) attack when parsing a maliciously crafted SWF file.

Therefore, the field in SWF related to invoking this CVE is the password field associated with the Protect tag. The patch corrects this vulnerability by changing the method of reading the password to `readString`, which inherently ensures that the data is null-terminated, thus preventing the buffer over-read scenario by correctly handling the password data as a string up to a null terminator.
