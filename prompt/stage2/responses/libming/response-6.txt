Given the correction and focusing on the details surrounding CVE-2016-9827 and its patch, if the root cause involves 'readBytes' not ensuring that the parsed password is null-terminated, this issue directly relates to handling the Protect tag within a SWF file.

The Protect tag in SWF files is typically used to prevent SWF files from being imported into most SWF editing tools, and it can optionally contain a password. If the data from this tag, specifically the password, is read into a buffer without proper null termination (as would be the case when using `readBytes` without ensuing the buffer is properly null-terminated), this can lead to buffer over-read vulnerabilities. When the content is not null-terminated, functions that expect a null-terminated string (like many string processing functions in C) can read past the intended buffer, possibly leading to a denial of service or other undefined behaviors.

Therefore, the field in SWF files related to invoking CVE-2016-9827 is the password field within the Protect tag. The vulnerability arises from the improper handling of this password field, leading to a buffer over-read condition when the tool processes a crafted SWF file containing a Protect tag with a password. The patch addresses this by ensuring the data read for the password is treated as a string (with `readString`), which would inherently handle the issue of ensuring null termination and prevent reading beyond the buffer's end.
