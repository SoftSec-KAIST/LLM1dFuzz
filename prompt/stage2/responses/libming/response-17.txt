The field in SWF related to invoking CVE-2016-9827 is the "Protect" tag's password field. The vulnerability is specific to how this password field was incorrectly handled when parsing SWF files using the listswf tool in libming. The original code did not treat the password field as a string properly, which led to a potential buffer over-read situation. The Protect tag in an SWF file is used to prevent the file from being imported into most SWF editors, and optionally, a password can be provided to protect the file further. The handling of this optional password was at the core of the vulnerability before the patch was applied.
