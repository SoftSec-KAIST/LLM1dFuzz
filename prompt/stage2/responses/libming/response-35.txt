Based on the clarification regarding the root cause being the `readBytes` function's failure to ensure the parsed password is null-terminated, and with reference to the provided patch details, the SWF field related to invoking this CVE (CVE-2016-9827) is the Protect tag's Password field.

The Protect tag in an SWF file is used for enabling simple protection of the SWF's content, often requiring a password to allow editing of the SWF file in Flash authoring software. The vulnerability arises from how the password associated with the Protect tag is parsed. Before the patch, the `readBytes` function was used to read the password data directly based on a specified length, which did not guarantee that the resulting data would be null-terminated. 

This improper handling could lead to scenarios where functions expecting a null-terminated string (such as those involved in outputting the parsed data) could read beyond the intended buffer if they did not encounter a null terminator, thus leading to a buffer over-read and consequently to a Denial of Service (DoS). The patch fixes this issue by switching to `readString(f)`, which ensures that the password data is read as a null-terminated string, preventing the potential for buffer over-reads in this context.
