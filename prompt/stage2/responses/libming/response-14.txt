Based on the information provided and the clarification, the root cause of CVE-2016-9827 is indeed the fact that the function `readBytes` used in the `parseSWF_PROTECT` function does not ensure that the parsed password is null-terminated. This can lead to a buffer over-read when the password is used later in the program, as it might read beyond the allocated buffer if it does not encounter a null terminator, expecting it to signify the end of a string.

Given this clarification, the specific SWF file field related to invoking this CVE is the "Protect tag's Password." In SWF files, the Protect tag is used to prevent SWF files from being imported by most SWF authoring tools, effectively serving as a simple form of protection or DRM. If a password is provided with the Protect tag, the tag acts as a more secure protection mechanism, requiring the password to be entered to import the SWF file into authoring tools. However, this security feature also becomes a vector for exploiting the CVE in question due to the improper handling of the password's termination in the vulnerable versions of libming. The exploit occurs when a specially crafted SWF file with a Protect tag is parsed by the affected software, leading to the denial of service condition described.
