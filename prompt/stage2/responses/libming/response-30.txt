The field in SWF related to invoking CVE-2016-9827 is the "Protect tag's Password" field. In the context of SWF files, the Protect tag is used to indicate that the SWF file is protected. The vulnerability was specifically in how libming's listswf tool processed the Protect tag's Password field. Instead of treating it as a string and ensuring its proper termination, the original code improperly read the data as a raw byte sequence based on the tag's length, leading to potential buffer over-read issues when handling crafted SWF files containing malformed or malicious Protect tags. The patch corrects this by treating the Password field as a string, thus mitigating the vulnerability.
