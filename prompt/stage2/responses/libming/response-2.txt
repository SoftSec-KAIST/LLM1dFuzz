Apologies for the confusion in the previous response. Given the corrected information, the root cause of CVE-2016-9827 is indeed that the `readBytes` function does not ensure that the parsed password is null-terminated, which could lead to a buffer over-read when processing this untethered data.

Relative to the specific field in SWF files that is involved in triggering this vulnerability, we can infer from the context provided by the patch and the description of the problem that the Protect tag's password field within SWF files is the one related to invoking this CVE. The Protect tag in SWF files is used to add a simple form of protection to discourage unauthorized viewing and editing of the file. It can optionally contain a password, which, if not handled correctly—as seen in this CVE—can lead to security vulnerabilities such as denial of service (DoS) through a buffer over-read.

The parsing of this specifically crafted or malformed password field from the Protect tag, when not ensuring null-termination as in using `readBytes`, causes the described vulnerability. By changing the method of reading this password to `readString`, which by its operation ensures that the string is null-terminated, the patch provides a mitigation against this type of vulnerability by preventing potential buffer over-read scenarios.
