The field in the SWF file related to invoking CVE-2016-9827 is the Protect tag's password field. This vulnerability is triggered when the `listswf` tool in libming processes a crafted SWF file containing a Protect tag with its password data being handled improperly. The original code used `readBytes` to read the password directly from the file based on a given length, which did not ensure proper string termination and could lead to a buffer over-read. The patch corrects this by reading the password as a string with `readString`, which likely ensures the data is null-terminated, preventing the buffer over-read vulnerability.
