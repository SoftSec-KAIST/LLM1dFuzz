The specific field in SWF files related to invoking CVE-2016-9827 is the Protect tag's password field. The vulnerability arises from how the Protect tag's password was read and processed by the listswf tool in libming 0.4.7. 

The Protect tag in SWF files is used for simple protection mechanisms, often just to deter casual decompilation or reverse engineering of the SWF content. It can include a password, which ostensibly would need to be known to unlock or decompile the SWF content fully. 

The original implementation used `readBytes(f, length)` to read the password directly from the file, based on a specified `length`. This method was susceptible to buffer over-read if the data did not end with a null-terminating character, expecting the input to behave like a properly null-terminated string. This could lead to denial of service as the software might attempt to access memory beyond the allocated buffer when treating this input as a string.

The patch changes the approach by using `readString(f)`, which reads characters until a null-terminating character is encountered, ensuring the data is always treated correctly as a string and preventing buffer over-read by taking into account string termination.

Hence, the field related to this CVE is specifically the password field within the Protect tag of an SWF file.
