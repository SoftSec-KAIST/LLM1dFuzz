Given the clarification that the root cause of CVE-2016-9827 is that the 'readBytes' function does not ensure the parsed password is null-terminated, it's clear that this oversight could lead to a buffer over-read when the program attempts to read or process the loaded data as a null-terminated string, which is a common expectation in C programming. 

Considering the details, this vulnerability is directly related to handling the Protect tag's password in SWF files. From the provided patch and description, it's evident that when the Protect tag (a feature within SWF files used to prevent unauthorized viewing and editing) is present with a password, the original handling mechanism didn't properly ensure that the loaded password string was safely terminated. This oversight could allow remote attackers to craft SWF files in such a manner that causes a denial of service (through buffer over-read) when processed by the listswf tool in libming.

In Flash files (SWF), the Protect tag can be used to "protect" the content, optionally requiring a password to edit the file. The vulnerability arises specifically from the incorrect handling of this password field. Given the context, it's not merely about the incorrect function being utilized (`readBytes` instead of `readString`), but also about the failure to ensure that parsed content, expected to be a string, is properly null-terminated to prevent reading beyond the allocated buffer when the string is used later in the program execution.
