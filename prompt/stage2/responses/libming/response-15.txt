The field in SWF files related to invoking CVE-2016-9827 is the Protect tag's password field. The vulnerability occurs when the listswf tool of the libming library improperly reads this password from a crafted SWF file. The problematic handling of this field can lead to a denial of service (buffer over-read) as the software attempts to process the Protect tag.

The Protect tag in SWF files is used to prevent unauthorized viewing and importing of the SWF file's source code, essentially "protecting" the file from certain types of manipulation or decompilation. It can contain a password, which would be required to unlock or decompile the SWF. In the context of this vulnerability, it's the handling of this password - specifically, how it's read from the SWF file - that is at issue. The flaw was that the password was being read using a method (`readBytes`) that did not ensure proper termination and handling of the string, leading to the possibility of reading beyond the buffer allocated for the password data.

By changing the reading method to `readString`, the patch ensures that the password is treated as a null-terminated string, avoiding the buffer over-read issue and mitigating the vulnerability.
