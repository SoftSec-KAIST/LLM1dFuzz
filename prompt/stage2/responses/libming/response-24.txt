Given the correction and focusing specifically on the information provided and the context of the vulnerability in libming 0.4.7 related to CVE-2016-9827, the field in SWF related to invoking this CVE is the "Protect" tag. The Protect tag in SWF files is used for preventing SWF files from being imported into most SWF authoring software and can optionally contain a password to add a layer of security. 

The incorrect handling of the password associated with the Protect tag, where `readBytes(f, length)` does not ensure the parsed password is null-terminated, is the root cause. This could lead to a buffer over-read if the software reads beyond the intended data when handling a crafted SWF file containing a Protect tag. The patch fixes this by changing the reading method to `readString(f)`, ensuring the password string is properly terminated, thereby preventing the buffer over-read vulnerability.
