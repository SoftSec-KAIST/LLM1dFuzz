Given the corrected root cause—that the function `readBytes` does not ensure the parsed password is null-terminated—the CVE would be invoked when handling the "Protect" tag in an SWF file. The Protect tag in SWF files is used to set a password for adding an additional layer of access control to the SWF file's content, preventing unauthorized viewing and editing of the SWF content. 

This vulnerability, CVE-2016-9827, arises in the context of parsing this specific tag within the SWF file. When the Protect tag's payload (assumed to be a password or encrypted data) is not correctly null-terminated after using `readBytes` for parsing, it leads to a buffer over-read condition as the parsing operation may read beyond the intended buffer boundary, expecting to find a null terminator. The updated patch corrects this behavior by replacing the `readBytes` function with `readString`, which inherently ensures the read operation stops at a null terminator, effectively resolving the potential denial of service vulnerability that arises from mishandling the Protect tag's data.
