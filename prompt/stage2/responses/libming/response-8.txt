The field in SWF files related to invoking CVE-2016-9827 is the **Password** field within the **Protect** tag. This field's improper handling, specifically how it was read from the SWF file, led to the vulnerability. The Protect tag in SWF files is used for simple protection mechanisms by including a password that needs to be provided for editing the SWF content. However, the issue arose from reading this password data incorrectly, leading to a buffer over-read vulnerability when processing specially crafted SWF files.
