The field in the SWF related to invoking CVE-2016-9827 is the Protect tag's password. The vulnerability arises when parsing the Protect tag within a SWF file due to the incorrect handling of the password field. The patch provided for the vulnerability changes how this password field is parsed - from using `readBytes` to `readString`, ensuring that the data is treated correctly as a string, likely preventing a buffer over-read condition.

The Protect tag in SWF files is used to enable simple protection of the SWF content, typically by requesting a password before allowing the file to be imported into Flash editing tools. The vulnerability in libming 0.4.7 was introduced because the original parsing did not ensure a safe, string-based handling of the password field of the Protect tag, which could allow a crafted SWF file to cause a denial of service through a buffer over-read scenario.
