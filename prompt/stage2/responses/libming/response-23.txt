Given the clarification that the root cause of CVE-2016-9827 is that the 'readBytes' function does not ensure the parsed password is null-terminated, leading to a buffer over-read, and correlating this with the nature of the patch provided, we can deduce more precisely which field in an SWF file is related to invoking this CVE.

The problematic handling occurs in the code that parses the Protect tag within SWF files. The Protect tag is used to restrict the ability to import an SWF file into an authoring tool like Adobe Animate. Optionally, it can include a password that needs to be provided for editing the SWF file.

The vulnerability specifically pertains to the way this password is read when parsing the Protect tag. In the original, vulnerable implementation, the code utilized `readBytes` to read a sequence of bytes designated as the password based on a specified length attribute. This operation didn't ensure that the resulting password was null-terminated, which is crucial for managing strings in C. Reading beyond the allocated buffer can occur because the code might continue to read adjacent memory until it happens upon a null terminator, which is beyond the intended buffer. This condition can lead to a denial of service through a buffer over-read, as detailed in the CVE.

The Protect tag is therefore the SWF field related to invoking this CVE, as improper handling of the password contained within this tag when using `readBytes` (without ensuring null termination) is what leads to the vulnerability. The fix involves changing the reading function to `readString`, which inherently expects a null-terminated string, addressing the root cause by correctly parsing the password as a string and avoiding the buffer over-read issue.
