Given the corrected root cause, that the vulnerability is due to the 'readBytes' function not ensuring the parsed password is null-terminated, we're dealing with a situation where a missing null terminator can cause a buffer over-read. This issue would manifest during the handling of the Protect tag in an SWF file.

The Protect tag in SWF files is utilized to prevent SWF files from being imported by authoring tools, essentially acting as a basic form of protection against unauthorized editing. The tag can optionally include a password, which must be provided if the file is to be imported despite the protection.

In light of the correct root cause, the field in SWF directly related to invoking CVE-2016-9827 is the password field within the Protect tag. Improper handling of this password—specifically, the failure to ensure it is null-terminated when read into memory—can lead to a buffer over-read situation when the affected function attempts to process or display the password, hence resulting in a denial of service (DoS).

The patch mentioned in the original query addresses this issue not by directly ensuring null termination but instead by changing the method used to read the password from `readBytes` to `readString`. The `readString` function inherently reads a null-terminated string, thereby remedying the underlying issue by ensuring the parsed password is properly terminated, preventing the buffer over-read vulnerability from being exploited through specially crafted SWF files with Protect tags.
