The field in an SWF file related to invoking CVE-2016-9827 is the "Protect tag's Password" field. This field becomes relevant when processing a SWF file that contains a Protect tag, which is used to indicate that the SWF file is protected. The vulnerability is triggered when handling the password associated with this Protect tag incorrectly, specifically by reading it as a series of bytes directly from the file without proper validation or consideration for it being a null-terminated string, thus leading to a potential buffer over-read condition. The patch addresses the issue by changing how the Protect tag's Password is read, switching from a byte-based read to a string-based read operation, thus mitigating the vulnerability.
