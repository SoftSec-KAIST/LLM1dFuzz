Given the clarification that the root cause of CVE-2016-9827 is because the `readBytes` function does not ensure the parsed password is null-terminated, leading to a buffer over-read condition, we can closely associate this vulnerability with the handling of the "Protect" tag in SWF files.

SWF files contain various tags that instruct actions or contain data for rendering the Flash content. Among these tags, the "Protect" tag plays a critical role in security. It is designed to prevent SWF files from being imported into most SWF editing tools, essentially serving as a means of content protection. The presence of a "Protect" tag can, without a valid password, lock the content from being edited, although viewing the content in a Flash Player is still permitted.

The CVE specifically mentions issues in parsing the Protect tag's Password. Normally, when a Protect tag with a password is encountered, the password should be read securely and processed correctly. However, because the original code uses `readBytes(f, length)` without ensuring the password is properly null-terminated, it creates an opportunity for exploitation. An attacker can craft an SWF file with a Protect tag that specifies a password length leading to a buffer over-read. This can cause the application to access memory beyond the intended buffer, causing a denial of service through a crash or potentially leaking memory contents.

Therefore, in the context of your question, the field in SWF related to invoking CVE-2016-9827 is the password associated with the "Protect" tag within the SWF file structure.
