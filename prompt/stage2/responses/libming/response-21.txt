The root cause of CVE-2016-9827, as clarified, is the function 'readBytes' not ensuring the parsed Protect tag password is null-terminated, which can result in a buffer over-read vulnerability due to incorrect handling of the password data.

Given this clarification and focusing on the specific field in SWF related to invoking this CVE, it's the Protect tag's password field that's central to the CVE. In SWF files, the Protect tag is used to restrict editing of the file contents. If a password field is present in the Protect tag (implying the SWF file is password-protected), it necessitates proper handling to ensure security operations like reading and parsing this field do not open up vulnerabilities.

From the information provided, an incorrect handling mechanism via the 'readBytes' function was used, which failed to ensure that the read data (password) was null-terminated. This incorrect handling could lead to the application consuming more data than intended (buffer over-read), potentially leading to a Denial of Service (DoS) if it reads beyond allocated buffers when processing a crafted SWF file.

Thus, within the SWF file structure, it is the password field in the Protect tag that relates directly to invoking this CVE, with the vulnerability being triggered by how libming's listswf tool initially parsed this specific piece of data from the SWF file.
