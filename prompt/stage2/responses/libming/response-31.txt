Given the clarification on the root cause of CVE-2016-9827, if the issue stems from the 'readBytes' function not ensuring the parsed password is null-terminated, this directly ties to how the Protect tag's password is handled in SWF files.

The SWF (Small Web Format or ShockWave Flash) file format, used for multimedia, vector graphics, and ActionScript in Adobe Flash applications, defines a variety of tags for different purposes. One of these tags is the Protect tag, which is used to prevent the SWF file from being imported into most SWF authoring tools, effectively serving as a rudimentary form of copyright protection. The Protect tag may contain a password, implying that it would require a password to import the SWF file into an authoring tool for editing.

Therefore, the field related to invoking CVE-2016-9827 is specifically the password field of the Protect tag in SWF files. When the Protect tag's password is badly handled due to the lack of null termination by the 'readBytes' function, it can lead to a buffer over-read scenario. The improper handling in this context would involve any SWF file that makes use of the Protect tag with a password. The vulnerability is exploited when these SWF files, particularly those crafted with malicious intent to exploit this specific mishandling, are processed by the affected libming version.
