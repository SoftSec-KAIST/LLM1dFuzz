Given the correct root cause of CVE-2016-9827 is that the 'readBytes' function does not ensure the parsed password is null-terminated, it then follows that this issue is specifically related to handling the Protect tag in SWF files. 

The Protect tag in SWF files is used for simple encryption that prohibits unauthorized viewing and editing of a SWF file’s script and assets. When a SWF file is protected, a password can be set, which is required to unlock and edit the file. However, it’s worth noting that the primary use case of the Protect tag is to prevent SWF decompilers from easily accessing the contents of the SWF file; it does not provide robust security against determined reverse engineering efforts.

The issue leading to CVE-2016-9827 manifests when libming processes an SWF file that includes a Protect tag with an associated password. The original use of `readBytes(f, length)` to parse the password directly from the SWF file without ensuring null termination could lead to a buffer over-read. This vulnerability exposes applications using libming to potential denial of service attacks if they attempt to process maliciously crafted SWF files containing a Protect tag designed to exploit this oversight. The patch addresses this by changing the parsing to `readString(f)`, which inherently ensures that the password is null-terminated, thereby mitigating the risk of a buffer over-read.
