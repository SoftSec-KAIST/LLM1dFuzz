My apologies for the confusion in the previous explanation. Based on the correct root cause you provided—that the function 'readBytes' does not ensure the parsed password is null terminated—and taking into account the information provided in the patch, the field in SWF that is related to invoking CVE-2016-9827 is the Protect tag's Password field.

To clarify, the Protect tag in an SWF file is used to indicate that the file is protected. The password associated with this tag, when used, would typically restrict access or modifications to the SWF content unless the correct password is provided. The vulnerability was due to how libming's listswf tool handled this particular field. By using 'readBytes' to read the Protect tag's Password, the data was not null-terminated, which is a common requirement for strings in C to indicate their end. This oversight could lead to buffer over-read vulnerabilities because consuming functions might continue reading memory beyond the intended limit while looking for a null terminator.

The patch fixes this issue by changing the method to read the Protect tag's Password as a string with 'readString', ensuring it is properly null-terminated and thereby preventing a buffer over-read condition when processing a crafted SWF file.
