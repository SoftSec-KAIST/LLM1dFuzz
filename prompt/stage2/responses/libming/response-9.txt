Based on the patch information provided, the field in the SWF file related to invoking CVE-2016-9827 is the Protect tag's Password field. The vulnerability stems from the mishandling of this Password field during the parsing process in `parseSWF_PROTECT`, where the password was previously read as a sequence of bytes (with `readBytes`) without ensuring it's properly terminated or handled as a string. This could lead to a buffer over-read when the parser attempted to access beyond the allocated buffer while processing a specially crafted SWF file.

The Protect tag is used in SWF files to indicate that the content is protected. The presence of a password within this tag (intended for use in authoring tools to restrict editing) indicates that the SWF content is password-protected. However, the vulnerability was not in the protection mechanism itself but in how the Protect tag's Password field was processed by the listswf tool in libming 0.4.7. By changing the method to `readString` for parsing the Password, the patch ensures that the Password field is treated as a string, which mitigates the risk of buffer over-read and, subsequent, denial of service attacks through crafted SWF files.
