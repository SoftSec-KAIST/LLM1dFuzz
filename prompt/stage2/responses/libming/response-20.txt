Apologies for the confusion earlier. Given the corrected root cause of CVE-2016-9827, which is that the 'readBytes' function does not ensure the parsed password is null-terminated, leading to a buffer over-read, the related field in an SWF file that invokes this CVE is the Protect tag's Password field.

The Protect tag in an SWF file is used to mark a file as protected, which can prevent it from being imported by Flash authoring tools. The Password field within this tag, when used, indicates that a password is set for further actions on the SWF file. According to the patch, the issue arises when parsing the Protect tagâ€™s Password field with the original `readBytes` function that led to the vulnerability.

By switching from `readBytes` to `readString`, the patch enforces null-termination of the parsed password, addressing the vulnerability by preventing a buffer over-read scenario when maliciously crafted SWF files are processed. This change ensures that the handling of the Password field in the Protect tag is safer and avoids potential denial of service attacks stemming from this oversight.
