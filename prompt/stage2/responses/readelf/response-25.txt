Based on the clarification provided, the core issue in CVE-2017-16828 indeed relates to an inadequate validation mechanism that could lead to an overflow scenario. Specifically, the vulnerability stems from handling the augmentation data within Call Frame Information (CFI) entries of DWARF debugging information in ELF files. When parsing this data, the calculation `start += augmentation_data_len`, if `augmentation_data_len` is excessively large, could cause the `start` pointer to overflow and wrap around, potentially bypassing the validity check `start >= end`. This could then lead to heap-based buffer over-read or possibly other impacts such as application crashes.

The field in ELF related to invoking this CVE directly corresponds to the augmentation data length (`augmentation_data_len`) field within the DWARF CFI entries. The DWARF debugging information, included in ELF binaries to provide detailed debugging information (like call frames, variables, and their scopes), can contain augmentation data intended for providing additional information about each frame. Incorrect or malicious handling of the length of this data can trigger the vulnerability.

Given the explanation, the overflow and subsequent bypass of the validity check can happen because of improperly validated lengths of augmentation data within the DWARF CFI entries in the ELF file. Remedying this requires ensuring that any calculations involving user-controlled or file-provided lengths are checked against integer overflow conditions and that any resulting pointer arithmetic does not lead to out-of-bounds memory access. The patch corrects this by adjusting the usage of `augmentation_data_len` and implementing proper checks to prevent overflow and ensure that calculated pointers remain within valid bounds of the allocated buffer.
