Based on the clarification regarding the root cause of CVE-2017-16828, which points out the issue stemming from the potential for the 'start' variable to overflow after adding 'augmentation_data_len', leading to bypassing the validity check 'start >= end', we can refine the analysis about the ELF field involved.

The vulnerability deals with the augmentation data processing within DWARF debugging information contained in ELF files. Specifically, this overflow and subsequent incorrect check can occur during the parsing of the "Common Information Entry" (CIE) or the "Frame Description Entry" (FDE) data structures within the `.debug_frame` section of an ELF file. Both these data structures can contain augmentation data, which is optional data that can be present after the initial fields of each entry.

The augmentation data's length is specified by a variable-length field that precedes the actual augmentation data in these entries. If a crafted ELF file specifies a particularly large value for this length, it may cause the `start` pointer (which points to the current position in the data being parsed) to overflow when incremented by `augmentation_data_len`. This could lead to skipping the validity check (`start >= end`), meant to ensure parsing does not go beyond the allocated buffer, thus possibly leading to a buffer over-read or other unintended behaviors.

In summary, the ELF fields related to invoking CVE-2017-16828 are found within the `.debug_frame` section, specifically within the augmentation data lengths of CIE and FDE records, part of the DWARF debugging information. Maliciously crafted lengths in these fields can trigger the vulnerability.
