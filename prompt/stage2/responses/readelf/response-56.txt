Based on the corrected understanding that the root cause of CVE-2017-16828 involves an integer overflow vulnerability where the 'start' variable can overflow after adding 'augmentation_data_len', the ELF field directly related to invoking this CVE would be tied to the augmentation data length of the DWARF debug frames.

In the context of ELF files, DWARF is a widely used format for storing debugging information. The augmentation data within a DWARF CIE (Common Information Entry) or FDE (Frame Description Entry) is optional data that can provide additional information about how to interpret the DWARF debugging information.

The vulnerability is triggered during the processing of this augmentation data length field within the DWARF sections of an ELF file. More precisely, when Binutils' functions such as `read_cie` and `display_debug_frames` attempt to read and process the augmentation data length from a DWARF CIE or FDE, an attacker-crafted ELF file can specify a large value for this length. This crafted length, when added to the 'start' pointer (which points to the current position within the ELF file's data being processed), can cause 'start' to overflow. This overflow can bypass the validity checks (such as 'start >= end'), intended to ensure that the reading process does not go beyond the allocated buffer. As a result, this leads to a heap-based buffer over-read, and potentially, an application crash or other unspecified impacts.

Hence, it's the augmentation data length field within the CIE or FDE of the DWARF sections in an ELF file that is the specific trigger for this vulnerability. This field is intended to indicate the size of the augmentation data that follows, but when improperly handled or checked, can lead to significant security vulnerabilities as demonstrated by CVE-2017-16828.
