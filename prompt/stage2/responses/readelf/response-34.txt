I apologize for the oversight in the initial explanation. Given the clarification, the root cause of CVE-2017-16828 is indeed the potential for 'start' to overflow after adding 'augmentation_data_len', which could bypass the validity check of 'start >= end'. This oversight allows for reading beyond the intended buffer when the sum of 'start' and 'augmentation_data_len' wraps around, effectively skipping the intended bounds check and leading to a heap-based buffer over-read situation.

The specific ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) field related to invoking this CVE would be located within the DWARF debugging information, more specifically, within the augmentation data of the CIE (Common Information Entry) or FDE (Frame Description Entry) records. The augmentation data length (`augmentation_data_len`) is read from the ELF file, and if this value is maliciously crafted to be excessively large, it can cause 'start' to overflow when incremented by 'augmentation_data_len'. The improper handling of this field, without adequate checks for overflow conditions when calculating the new position in the buffer (`start + augmentation_data_len`), would lead to the vulnerability being exploited.

To clarify, the ELF fields directly related are not the standard ELF headers but rather the contents of a .debug_frame section which is parsed for debugging information according to the DWARF standard, utilized by tools like GNU Binutils to extract, display, or manipulate debugging information.
