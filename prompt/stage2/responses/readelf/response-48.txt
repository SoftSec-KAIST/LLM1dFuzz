Given the clarification, the root cause of CVE-2017-16828 indeed centers around the bypassing of the validity check (`start >= end`) because of an integer overflow. This overflow can happen when adding `augmentation_data_len` to the variable `start`. If `augmentation_data_len` is exceptionally large, adding it to `start` could cause `start` to overflow and wrap around, potentially making it less than `end` even when, logically, it should point past the legitimate bounds of the buffer. This could lead to buffer over-read scenarios since the program would then attempt to read beyond the actual data, leading to crashes or undefined behavior.

### ELF Field Involved:

The exploitation and trigger of this CVE relate directly to the DWARF debugging information embedded within ELF files, specifically within the `.debug_frame` section. ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) files can contain DWARF debugging information that provides detailed descriptions of the data types and structures used by a program, as well as detailed call frames information.

The particular fields within this context are:
- **CIE (Common Information Entry)** and **FDE (Frame Description Entry)**: These entries contain augmentation data. The size of this augmentation data (i.e., `augmentation_data_len`) is read from the ELF file. If malformed or intentionally crafted to be malicious, it could be made unusually large.

When a tool from GNU Binutils (such as `objdump` or `readelf`) processes ELF files with DWARF debugging information, it reads the `.debug_frame` section to interpret the stack unwinding and debugging information. A crafted ELF file with specifically designed `augmentation_data_len` in its CIE or FDE could exploit this vulnerability by causing an integer overflow when `augmentation_data_len` is added to the `start` pointer. This condition would bypass the intended buffer end check, potentially leading to out-of-bounds memory access, constituting a Denial of Service (DoS) or possibly leading to other unintended impacts.

So, the exploitation of this vulnerability directly involves manipulating the fields related to DWARF CIE/FDE augmentation data lengths within the debugging sections of an ELF file.
