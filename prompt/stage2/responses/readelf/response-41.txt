Given the clarified root cause of CVE-2017-16828—where an integer overflow could occur causing the 'start' variable to overflow after adding 'augmentation_data_len,' thus potentially bypassing the 'start >= end' check—the specific field in an ELF file related to invoking this CVE would be associated with the data describing Call Frame Information (CFI) entries within the `.debug_frame` section or its equivalent for exception handling frames in the `.eh_frame` section. This is inferred from the code context and the mention of augmentation data, which is specific to how Dwarf CFI (Call Frame Information) is encoded within ELF files.

The `.debug_frame` section in an ELF file contains call frame information necessary for precise backtracing through stack frames, particularly during debugging or exception handling. The `.eh_frame` section serves a similar purpose but is mainly used for exception handling. Both sections contain Common Information Entries (CIE) and Frame Description Entries (FDE), with CIEs potentially containing augmentation data. The augmentation data is an optional part of CIEs that can include various forms of extended information such as pointers to additional data or flags indicating how the CIE or FDE should be interpreted.

An ELF file crafted with malicious intent could manipulate the length field of the augmentation data in a CIE (or the analogous data in an FDE) to trigger this overflow condition. Such manipulation would aim to create an integer overflow when the augmentation_data_len is added to the 'start' pointer (which points to the current location in the section being parsed). If the augmentation_data_len is sufficiently large, adding it to 'start' could cause 'start' to wrap around, resulting in 'start' being less than 'end' despite exceeding the actual end of the intended buffer. As a result, this could lead to reading beyond the buffer, causing a crash (denial of service) or potentially leading to other unspecified impacts.

Therefore, the specific ELF field related to invoking CVE-2017-16828 lies within the augmentation data length declaration in CIE records of the `.debug_frame` or `.eh_frame` sections, where an excessively large or crafted length value can lead to the described vulnerability.
