Based on the correction and focusing on the specific vulnerability pointed out—as the validity check `start >= end` can indeed be bypassed if the `start` variable overflows after adding `augmentation_data_len`—the ELF field related to this CVE would be associated with the augmentation data length within the Call Frame Information (CFI) entries of the `.debug_frame` section or possibly the `.eh_frame` section.

ELF files contain debugging information in sections like `.debug_frame` and `.eh_frame` that describe how to unwind the stack and how to restore the call frame (and hence the state of the CPU registers) to what they were at an earlier point in time. This information is critical for tools performing stack traces or for runtime environments handling exceptions.

The augmentation data within these sections is meant to provide additional information or modifications to the Common Information Entry (CIE) or Frame Descriptor Entries (FDEs) of these .debug_frame and .eh_frame sections. The length of this augmentation data is specified in the section's data itself, indicating how much data a parser should read as part of processing each CIE or FDE.

CVE-2017-16828 exploits the handling of this augmentation data length, where an integer overflow can occur if the length value is maliciously crafted. By setting `augmentation_data_len` to a value that, when added to the pointer `start`, causes an overflow, an attacker can bypass checks intended to ensure that `start` does not read beyond `end`, the calculated end of the buffer. This overflow can lead to a scenario where the program reads beyond the intended memory region, leading to a denial of service (application crash) or potentially exploiting the overflow for arbitrary code execution or information disclosure.

In summary, this CVE directly relates to the way ELF fields associated with the processing of `.debug_frame` and `.eh_frame` section augmentation data lengths are handled, particularly within the context of parsing and validating CIE and FDE entries.
