Apologies for the oversight. Given the correct root cause of CVE-2017-16828 being an integer overflow that enables the bypass of the validity check `start >= end` by causing `start` to overflow after adding `augmentation_data_len`, the issue lies in the handling of augmentation data length in the processing of DWARF debug information in ELF files.

The specific ELF-related functionality invoking this CVE is the parsing of the augmentation data length field within the DWARF Common Information Entry (CIE) or Frame Descriptor Entries (FDEs). This information is part of the DWARF debugging information that may be included in ELF files to provide detailed debugging information. 

In DWARF, both CIE and FDEs can contain an optional "augmentation" section that provides additional information extending their standard definitions. The length of this augmentation data is specified by a preceding length field. If this length field is crafted to be overly large (exploiting the integer overflow in `start += augmentation_data_len` operation), it can cause `start` to wrap around if `start + augmentation_data_len` exceeds the maximum value representable by the type of `start`. This would result in an incorrect computation that bypasses the safety check intended to ensure that the pointer `start` does not move beyond `end`, which marks the bound of the buffer. Consequently, this allows reading beyond the allocated buffer, leading to a heap-based buffer over-read, denial of service, or potentially other unspecified impacts.

The ELF fields specifically involved would not be directly named here, as this issue arises from processing the contents (DWARF debug information) contained within the ELF file, rather than from the static structure of ELF headers or sections themselves. It is the handling of dynamic content (DWARF CIE/FDE augmentation data) within these debugging information sections that triggers the vulnerability.
