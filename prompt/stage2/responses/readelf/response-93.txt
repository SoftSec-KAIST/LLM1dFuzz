Apologies for the confusion earlier. Given the correct root cause of CVE-2017-16828, which involves the potential bypassing of the validity check 'start >= end' due to an integer overflow when adding `augmentation_data_len` to `start`, the field in the ELF file that is directly related to triggering this vulnerability is the **augmentation data length** in the Dwarf debugging information.

Dwarf debugging information uses Common Information Entries (CIE) and Frame Description Entries (FDE) within the `.debug_frame` section of an ELF file. The augmentation data is part of CIEs and FDEs and provides additional information that may be required by specific implementations. The length of this data is specified by a field preceding the actual augmentation data.

An attacker can craft an ELF file with a CIE or FDE that specifies an augmentation data length (`augmentation_data_len`) that, when added to the current position pointer (`start`), results in an integer overflow. This overflow can make the subsequent `start >= end` check (which is intended to ensure that the read operation does not go past the buffer holding the ELF file's data) pass incorrectly. Thus, the software might attempt to read beyond the allocated buffer based on the overflowed and wrapped-around `start` pointer, leading to a buffer over-read, denial of service (application crash), or potentially other unspecified impacts.

This vulnerability underscores the importance of properly validating the lengths and sizes of data read from files, especially when dealing with complex file formats like ELF that may contain user-defined or variable-length data fields such as the augmentation data in Dwarf debugging information.
