Given the more precise identification of the root cause as the potential bypassing of the 'start >= end' validity check due to 'start' variable overflowing after the addition of 'augmentation_data_len', we can deduce the specific field in ELF that triggers this vulnerability.

The critical issue arises in the handling of the Call Frame Information (CFI) or Debug Frames within ELF files, particularly how augmentation data lengths are processed. In ELF files, debug information is stored in sections, with `.debug_frame` being relevant here. The Common Information Entry (CIE) and Frame Description Entries (FDEs) within this `.debug_frame` section include fields for augmentation data. The CIE describes how a frame is unwound, whereas FDEs provide instructions for creating frame unwind information for a function.

The augmentation data in CIE or FDE records can indicate additional information needed to interpret or enhance the frame information. The vulnerability is specifically triggered by how `augmentation_data_len` is read and processed. In the given context, after parsing the augmentation data length (which is done using the `READ_ULEB` macro to read a ULEB128-encoded value), the code attempts to increase the `start` pointer by `augmentation_data_len` to move past the augmentation data:

```c
augmentation_data = start;
start += augmentation_data_len;
```

However, if `augmentation_data_len` is excessively large due to corruption or malicious manipulation, adding this length to the `start` pointer can cause an integer overflow. This overflow could make the new value of `start` less than `end`, bypassing the check meant to verify the data does not extend beyond the expected section end. This leads to reading beyond the allocated buffer (buffer over-read), which is the heap-based buffer over-read mentioned in the CVE description.

Therefore, the ELF field related to invoking CVE-2017-16828 is essentially the length field of the augmentation data within the CIE and FDE records of the `.debug_frame` section. Maliciously crafted or corrupted ELF files can exploit this vulnerability by including incorrect lengths for this augmentation data, leading to potential denial of service (crash) or other unspecified impacts due to improper parsing and handling of this data.
