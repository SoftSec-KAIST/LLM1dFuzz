I apologize for the oversight in my initial response. Based on your clarification, it's apparent that the real issue addressed by the CVE-2017-16828 patch involves an integer overflow that can occur when `augmentation_data_len` is added to the `start` pointer. If `augmentation_data_len` is sufficiently large, it could cause the `start` pointer to overflow and wrap around, potentially bypassing the sanity check `(start >= end)`. This specific type of vulnerability allows attackers to craft ELF files that cause the application to read beyond the intended buffer, leading to a heap-based buffer over-read, application crash, and denial of service (DoS), or potentially executing unspecified malicious outcomes.

Addressing the question about which field in the ELF format is specifically related to invoking this CVE:

The vulnerability relates to the handling of augmentation data within the `.debug_frame` section of an ELF file. In the context of ELF files and the DWARF debugging information they can contain, the Common Information Entry (CIE) and Frame Description Entry (FDE) are key components residing in this section. These entries provide information necessary for stack unwinding and the execution of exception handling, among other debugging tasks.

The specific field that leads to this vulnerability is the length of the augmentation data associated with these CIE or FDE entries. Augmentation data can contain a variety of extended information related to frame handling and is prefixed by a length field. It is the manipulation of this length field, where an attacker can specify an excessively large value, that can lead to the integer overflow, bypassing checks and resulting in the vulnerabilities described.

To prevent such issues, the patch adjusted how the length of the augmentation data is handled, moving to a wider or more appropriately sized data type (`bfd_size_type` instead of `unsigned long`) and including additional checks to ensure the length does not cause pointer arithmetic to overflow, specifically making sure the calculation of `start + augmentation_data_len` does not exceed `end` or wrap around. 

Thank you for the opportunity to correct my response and provide a more accurate explanation of the underlying issue and its relation to the ELF format.
