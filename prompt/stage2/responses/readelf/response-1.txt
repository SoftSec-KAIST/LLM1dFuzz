Given the correct root cause you've pointed out—that the vulnerability lies in the bypassing of the 'start >= end' check due to an integer overflow occurring after adding 'augmentation_data_len' to the 'start' pointer—the field in the ELF file most directly related to invoking this CVE would be linked with DWARF debug information, specifically the augmentation data length within the Common Information Entry (CIE) or a Frame Description Entry (FDE) of .debug_frame sections.

DWARF debugging information is used by debuggers to unwind the stack and find out where the code is in the source files. The .debug_frame section is part of this DWARF information and contains data describing how to unwind the stack frames. This section consists of a series of CIEs and FDEs:

- **Common Information Entry (CIE)**: This entry serves as a base for FDEs. It contains default information that can be referred to by subsequent FDEs, including how to interpret the FDE's instructions for stack unwinding.

- **Frame Description Entry (FDE)**: This specifies the frame unwinding information for a specific function or code segment, referencing a CIE for common information.

The FDE and CIE contain fields for the length of data entries, and in particular, they include augmentation data, which can be variable in length and is specified with an accompanying length field. The CVE is triggered when this length field is manipulated to create an integer overflow. By crafting an ELF file with a specific augmentation data length that, when added to the 'start' variable (which points to the current position in reading the .debug_frame data), results in an integer overflow, it could bypass the 'start >= end' check. This maliciously crafted length would lead the program to believe there's more data to read than there actually is, potentially leading to buffer over-read, application crashes, or other impacts.

Therefore, to directly answer your question, the field in the ELF that is related to invoking this CVE is the **augmentation data length field** within the entries (CIE or FDE) of the `.debug_frame` section of the DWARF debug information in an ELF file. Exploiting this vulnerability would involve crafting this field in such a way that it causes an overflow condition when processed by vulnerable versions of GNU Binutils.
