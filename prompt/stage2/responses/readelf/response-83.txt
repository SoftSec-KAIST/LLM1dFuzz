You're right; based on your clarification, the specific root cause of CVE-2017-16828 was related to a situation where the `start` pointer could overflow when `augmentation_data_len` was added to it. This situation could lead to bypassing the validity check `start >= end`, which was intended to ensure that the parser does not read beyond the allocated buffer. When this overflow occurs, it could result in reading past the end of the buffer, leading to the vulnerabilities described.

The field in ELF that is related to invoking this CVE is the augmentation data length within the Call Frame Information (CFI) entries of the .debug_frame section or possibly the .eh_frame section (if GNU extensions are used). These sections store information necessary for stack unwinding and exception handling. The augmentation data length field specifies the length of additional data (augmentation data) following the Common Information Entry (CIE) or the Frame Description Entry (FDE). If this length field is improperly validated—specifically, if an attacker can manipulate it to cause an integer overflow or underflow condition—it could allow bypassing the buffer boundary checks, thereby triggering the vulnerability. 

This highlights the importance of correctly handling and validating the lengths and sizes of various fields when parsing complex file formats like ELF to prevent security vulnerabilities.
