Based on the corrected root cause provided, that the vulnerability (CVE-2017-16828) can indeed be triggered due to an overflow of the `start` pointer when `augmentation_data_len` is added to it, bypassing the validity check `start >= end`, this vulnerability is specifically related to the handling of the "augmentation data" in the Call Frame Information (CFI) entries of ELF files. 

The ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) file serves as a common standard file format for executables, object code, shared libraries, and core dumps. Within ELF files, debugging information can be encoded using the DWARF standard, which may include Call Frame Information (CFI). CFI is used by debuggers and exception handling runtimes to unwind the call stack, i.e., to determine the call-chain of function calls leading to a specific point in the program.

The "augmentation data" mentioned in the vulnerability details is an optional part of the CIE (Common Information Entry) and FDE (Frame Description Entries) structures within the DWARF debugging information contained in ELF files. This augmentation data can provide additional information for the frame unwinding process, such as whether a function call uses a return address register, language-specific data for exceptions, or signal trampolines.

The vulnerability is specifically invoked when processing corrupt or malicious ELF files that contain crafted CFI entries where the augmentation data length (`augmentation_data_len`) is manipulated. Such manipulation can cause an integer overflow when the length is added to the `start` pointer (which points to the current position within the augmentation data), making `start + augmentation_data_len` wrap around if `augmentation_data_len` is sufficiently large. If this condition occurs, the overflow would allow the bypass of the buffer bounds check (`start >= end`), potentially leading to a buffer over-read or other unintended behavior. The buffer over-read could lead to a denial of service (application crash) or possibly other unspecified impacts as mentioned in the CVE description.

This manipulation and the consequent impact are tied to the augmentation data present in the CFI portion of the DWARF debugging information in the ELF file. This makes the augmentation data field within the ELF's DWARF debugging sections the specific target related to invoking CVE-2017-16828.
