Given the clarification on the root cause being the bypass of the validity check 'start >= end' due to a potential overflow when adding `augmentation_data_len` to `start`, it becomes clear that the vulnerability is closely related to the handling of augmentation data within the Call Frame Information (CFI) entries of the `.debug_frame` or `.eh_frame` sections in ELF files. 

The Call Frame Information (CFI) is essential for debugging and exception handling, providing a way to unwind and traverse stack frames. Each entry in these sections, starting with a Common Information Entry (CIE) or a Frame Description Entry (FDE), can include augmentation data. The augmentation data is optional and customizes or extends the information for a CIE or FDE. The length and content of this augmentation data can vary, and itâ€™s specified in the entries themselves.

The vulnerability described in CVE-2017-16828 is exploited by manipulating the length field of this augmentation data. Specifically, by crafting an ELF file with a CIE or FDE that includes an `augmentation_data_len` field with a value that, when added to the `start` pointer (pointing to the current position in the data being read), causes `start` to overflow. This can cause the program to bypass the intended check (`start >= end`) meant to prevent reading beyond the allocated buffer. A carefully crafted value might cause the program to either read before or beyond the intended memory area, potentially leading to a denial of service or enabling further exploitation based on how the out-of-bounds data is used.

In summary, the field in ELF related to invoking this CVE is the `augmentation_data_len` within the augmentation data of the Call Frame Information entries in the `.debug_frame` or `.eh_frame` sections. These sections' structure and the nature of the augmentation data make them the vectors through which this specific vulnerability can be exploited.
