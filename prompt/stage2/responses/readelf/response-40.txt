Understanding your clarification, the root cause of CVE-2017-16828 indeed involves the possibility of 'start' pointer overflow. This vulnerability specifically arises when 'start' pointer, which is used to point to the current position being parsed within a chunk of data in an ELF file, overflows due to adding a large 'augmentation_data_len'. This overflow can result in bypassing the validity check 'start >= end', leading to a situation where memory outside the intended buffer could be read or written to, which could cause a program crash or potentially execution of arbitrary code depending on the context.

Given this clarification, the field in ELF related to invoking this CVE would be associated with the augmentation data of the DWARF debug information, specifically within the Common Information Entry (CIE) or the Frame Description Entry (FDE) of the .debug_frame or .eh_frame sections. The ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) file format encompasses DWARF debugging information sections that tools like GNU Binutils can parse to display or manipulate debugging information.

These sections (.debug_frame and .eh_frame) contain CIEs and FDEs that give instructions on how to unwind the stack. Each CIE or FDE can contain augmentation data, which is designed to extend the information available for stack unwinding with vendor or system-specific data. The length of this augmentation data ('augmentation_data_len') is specified in the fields of these entries. If an ELF file is crafted to specify an excessively large size for augmentation data, it can trigger an integer overflow when 'start + augmentation_data_len' is computed, leading to the described vulnerability.

Therefore, the ELF fields directly related to invoking this CVE include the augmentation data length fields within CIE and FDE records of the .debug_frame and .eh_frame sections. Manipulating these fields with crafted values in a malicious ELF file could exploit this vulnerability.
