Based on the corrected root cause provided—that the vulnerability arises due to the possibility that the `start` variable can overflow when `augmentation_data_len` is added, bypassing the `start >= end` validity check—the specific field in ELF files related to invoking CVE-2017-16828 is tied to the augmentation data length in the DWARF debugging information sections. 

DWARF debugging information is utilized by various tools to debug applications, with data stored within ELF files. Within this context, Common Information Entries (CIE) and Frame Description Entries (FDE) in the `.debug_frame` section of an ELF file contain augmentation data, which provides additional information about the frame's properties.

The augmentation data length field, which specifies the size of augmentation data, can directly influence processing logic when reading and interpreting CIEs or FDEs. If an ELF file is crafted with a specially designed augmentation data length such that adding this length to the `start` pointer results in an overflow, it would cause the `start` pointer to wrap around and potentially point to a location earlier in memory than `end`. This invalid scenario should trigger a validity check failure, but because of the overflow, the check `start >= end` can mistakenly pass, leading to further processing of out-of-bounds or incorrect data. 

This incorrect processing can lead to heap-based buffer over-reads or application crashes, constituting a denial of service, and in some scenarios, could potentially be exploited further to execute arbitrary code or lead to unspecified impacts. The handling of the augmentation data length within the context of reading CIEs and FDEs in DWARF sections of ELF files is thus directly related to the exploitation of this CVE.
