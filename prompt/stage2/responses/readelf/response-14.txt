Based on the correction provided, the specific vulnerability described by CVE-2017-16828 involves an integer overflow that can occur when processing augmentation data within ELF files, specifically in how GNU Binutils handles DWARF debugging information. The overflow can happen when adding `augmentation_data_len` to the `start` pointer. If `augmentation_data_len` is large enough, this addition can overflow, making `start` wrap around and potentially bypass the validity check of `start >= end`. This situation can allow for a heap-based buffer over-read and potentially enable attackers to cause a denial of service (DoS) or execute arbitrary code due to the application crash or other undefined behaviors.

The field in ELF files that is related to invoking this CVE would be within the DWARF debugging information sections, specifically the parts that handle the augmentation data lengths within Common Information Entries (CIE) or Frame Description Entries (FDE) of the `.debug_frame` section. These entries contain fields for length values that, when improperly handled or maliciously crafted, can lead to the described overflow condition.

In the context of the DWARF debugging information, the augmentation data length (`augmentation_data_len`) field potentially leads to the security vulnerability if a crafted ELF file specifies a very large size for this field. Since this size directly influences memory operations and parsing logic, exploiting the lack of proper integer overflow checks before using `augmentation_data_len` to calculate memory addresses allows attackers to manipulate the application's execution flow.

To correct this, the patch specifically targeted improvements in how `augmentation_data_len` is handled, switching to a type capable of safely handling the computation (`bfd_size_type`) and implementing additional checks to prevent integer overflow scenarios.
