Based on the given description of the root cause, where the validity check 'start >= end' can be bypassed if the 'start' variable overflows after adding 'augmentation_data_len', the CVE is closely related to the processing of augmentation data within the Call Frame Information (CFI) entries in the `.debug_frame` section of an ELF file. 

The augmentation data is part of the Common Information Entry (CIE) and Frame Description Entry (FDE) in the `.debug_frame` section, which is used by debuggers for stack unwinding and other debugging operations. Specifically, this data provides additional information about the frame's layout and how to interpret it.

In the context of CVE-2017-16828, the corruption or malicious crafting of the ELF file could involve specifying an artificially large or incorrect length for the augmentation data in a CIE or FDE. The incorrect handling of this length value, particularly without proper checks for integer overflows, could lead to situations where the calculation of the new position in the data (`start += augmentation_data_len`) results in an overflow. This overflow could subsequently bypass checks meant to prevent reading beyond the allowed memory region (the 'start >= end' check), leading to buffer over-reads, application crashes, or potentially other unspecified impacts.

Thus, the specific field in the ELF related to invoking this CVE would be the length of the augmentation data associated with CIEs and FDEs in the `.debug_frame` section.
