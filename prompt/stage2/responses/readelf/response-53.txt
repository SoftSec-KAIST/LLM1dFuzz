The root cause of CVE-2017-16828 is indeed informed by a condition where the 'start' pointer could overflow upon adding 'augmentation_data_len', thus potentially allowing the bypass of the 'start >= end' check meant to ensure memory safety. This would allow for a crafted ELF file to trigger the vulnerability by specifying augmentation data in a way that manipulates this overflow.

Given the context, the specific field in ELF files that can trigger this CVE would relate to the augmentation data length within the Call Frame Information (CFI) entries of the `.debug_frame` section or similar sections dealing with debugging information. In ELF files, the CFI provides information necessary for unwinding the stack and is part of the DWARF debugging information commonly used by debuggers and other tools to understand the state of the stack during program execution.

The `augmentation_data_len` field, which specifies the length of augmentation data associated with a CIE (Common Information Entry) or FDE (Frame Description Entry), directly influences the processing logic that could lead to the described vulnerability. An attacker could craft an ELF file with a CIE or FDE containing an `augmentation_data_len` value designed to cause an overflow when added to the `start` pointer. If successful, this could lead to buffer over-reads, memory corruption, and potentially execution of arbitrary code depending on how the memory structures are manipulated post-overflow.

In summary, exploiting CVE-2017-16828 involves manipulating the augmentation data length field (`augmentation_data_len`) within the CFI records of an ELF file, specifically within its debugging sections that employ DWARF information, like `.debug_frame`. This manipulation seeks to cause an integer overflow that bypasses safety checks and leads to hazardous memory operations.
