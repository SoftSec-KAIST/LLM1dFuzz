My apologies for the oversight in my initial explanation. Based on the corrected root cause of CVE-2017-16828, which is the overflow of the 'start' variable after adding 'augmentation_data_len' enabling the bypass of the 'start >= end' check, the ELF field most closely related to invoking this CVE would be the DWARF debugging information, specifically the augmentation data length within a DWARF CIE (Common Information Entry) or FDE (Frame Description Entry).

In ELF files, DWARF information is used to describe the association between the source program and the generated executable code. This includes data for debugging, such as variable locations, call stack unwind information, and more. The CIE and FDE entries within the `.debug_frame` or `.eh_frame` sections are part of this information, where the CIE provides context for the stack frame information present in the FDE. 

Each CIE and FDE has an augmentation string and corresponding augmentation data, which can have variable length. The length of this augmentation data is specified within the ELF file. As described in the vulnerability details, if the augmentation data length field is manipulated in a carefully crafted ELF file, it could lead to an integer overflow when adding this length to the 'start' pointer. This overflow might skip the validity check ('start >= end'), causing the read pointer 'start' to move past the intended 'end' of the buffer in memory, leading to a buffer over-read or other unintended behaviors.

Such manipulations exploit the handling of the augmentation data length field within the DWARF CIE or FDE entries, making it the ELF field related to invoking this CVE. Ensuring that software correctly checks for overflow conditions when performing arithmetic operations on pointers or indices is essential to prevent vulnerabilities of this nature.
