Apologies for the confusion earlier. Based on the corrected root cause description of CVE-2017-16828, which is the bypassing of the validity check `start >= end` due to an overflow in the `start` variable after adding `augmentation_data_len`, we can infer the ELF field involved.

The problematic component is tied to the augmentation data length within the ELF's "Call Frame Information" (CFI) entries, part of the DWARF debugging information. The CFI entries include information necessary for exception handling and stack unwinding, among other uses. Specifically, the augmentation data's length, as indicated in the Call Frame Interface (CIE) or Frame Description Entries (FDEs), can trigger this vulnerability when overly large values are manipulated, leading to the said overflow.

Thus, to directly answer the question: The field in the ELF file that is related to invoking this CVE is the augmentation data length within the DWARF CFI entries (either in CIE or FDEs). This field's manipulation with specifically crafted values can lead to integer overflow situations exploited by CVE-2017-16828.
