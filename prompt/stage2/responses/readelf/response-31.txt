Considering the corrected root cause of CVE-2017-16828 as an overflow condition in the computation involving the `start` variable after adding `augmentation_data_len`, which can potentially bypass the validity check (`start >= end`), the specific ELF field related to invoking this vulnerability would be associated with the augmentation data within the Call Frame Information (CFI) entries of the `.debug_frame` section or the `.eh_frame` section in ELF binaries.

The vulnerability is triggered during the parsing of the augmentation data length in Dwarf Call Frame Information (CFI) sections. These sections store data that is essential for unwinding the stack, such as during exception handling or backtracing during debugging. The augmentation data length field specifies how much augmentation data follows the initial Common Information Entry (CIE) or Frame Description Entry (FDE) data structures. An improperly large value or corrupt value for this length can lead to an integer overflow when it's added to the `start` pointer, potentially causing the subsequent check (`start >= end`) intended to prevent reading beyond the buffer end to be bypassed.

This specific scenario occurs when processing ELF files with crafted or corrupt augmentation data length values in the `.debug_frame` or `.eh_frame` sections that, when added to the current position pointer `start`, cause an overflow leading to incorrect memory access operations. It highlights the importance of robustly validating the size and integrity of input data when parsing complex file formats like ELF to prevent security vulnerabilities.
