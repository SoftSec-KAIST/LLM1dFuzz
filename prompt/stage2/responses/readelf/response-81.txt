Given the clarification, the root cause of CVE-2017-16828 indeed revolves around the potential for the 'start' variable to overflow when 'augmentation_data_len' is added to it. This overflow can bypass the validity check 'start >= end', which is supposed to ensure that the pointer does not access memory beyond the intended buffer. If 'start' overflows, it can result in reading past the buffer allocated for the ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) file's data, causing a heap-based buffer over-read, application crash, or other unspecified impacts.

From the provided information and the context of the issue being within the handling of Debug Frames in an ELF file, the specific field in the ELF format related to this vulnerability is the augmentation data length within the Common Information Entry (CIE) or Frame Description Entry (FDE) in the `.eh_frame` or `.debug_frame` sections. These sections contain data used for unwinding the stack and debugging, respectively.

The augmentation data is an optional part of the CIE and FDE structures that can contain various kinds of additional information. The length of this data is specified by a field within the structure itself. In ELF files, CIEs and FDEs are used by tools (like debuggers and exception handlers) to interpret the call frame information needed for backtracing, exception handling, or unwinding the stack.

In the vulnerable versions of Binutils, the function was not safely checking the augmentation data length against the end of the buffer, leading to scenarios where an improperly large length (due to integer overflow when added to 'start') would bypass safety checks, potentially causing buffer over-read scenarios when processing malformed ELF files.

Therefore, invoking this CVE involves creating a crafted ELF file with a CIE or FDE that includes augmented data length values manipulated such that when they are added to the 'start' variable, they cause an integer overflow. This manipulation misleads the safety check, possibly resulting in data being read past the buffer allocated for the ELF file in memory, exploiting the vulnerability to cause denial of service or other impacts.
