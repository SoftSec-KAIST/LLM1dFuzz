Based on the clarification regarding the root cause of CVE-2017-16828 and the information provided previously, the ELF field relevant to invoking this CVE revolves around the handling of "augmentation data length" in the processing of DWARF debug frames. The vulnerability specifically occurs in situations where reading the "augmentation data" from an ELF file leads to an integer overflow. This overflow can happen when the size of the augmentation data (`augmentation_data_len`) is manipulated or crafted in a way that, when added to the `start` pointer, causes the `start` to overflow and bypass the validity check `start >= end`.

This issue involves the DWARF debugging information, which ELF files can contain. DWARF is a widely used format for debugging data, and it includes a mechanism called "Common Information Entries" (CIE) and "Frame Description Entries" (FDE), which are critical for stack unwinding and other debugging processes. The augmentation data in question is part of this debugging information, which can be interpreted or displayed by tools like GNU Binutils.

The specific ELF field related to this vulnerability lies within the DWARF debug frame sectionsâ€”`.debug_frame` or `.eh_frame` sections of the ELF file. These sections contain CIEs and FDEs where the augmentation data length is specified. An attacker can craft an ELF file with malformed or intentionally designed augmentation data length values in these sections to exploit this vulnerability, causing an application that processes such ELF files (like an ELF parser or debugger) to experience an integer overflow. This leads to a heap-based buffer over-read or application crash, and potentially could be exploited further, depending on the context and how the overflowing data is used or misused after the overflow.

In summary, the ELF field related to CVE-2017-16828 involves the augmentation data length within the CIEs and FDEs of the `.debug_frame` or `.eh_frame` sections, which are components of the DWARF debug information in ELF files.
