Based on the corrected root cause description you provided, wherein the essential issue is the bypassing of the validity check ('start >= end') due to 'start' variable overflowing after adding 'augmentation_data_len', the ELF field related to invoking CVE-2017-16828 would be related to the augmentation data length in the DWARF debugging information, specifically within the Common Information Entry (CIE) or Frame Description Entry (FDE) records of the .debug_frame section.

DWARF debugging information is used by debuggers to understand the state of the program at any given point during its execution, and it includes details such as the call stack, variable values, and how to unwind the stack. The .debug_frame section of an ELF file contains a series of data entries called CIEs and FDEs that describe how to unwind the call stack and how to restore the register values. Each CIE or FDE has associated augmentation data, which can provide additional information for stack unwinding procedures.

The augmentation data length field, which specifies the length of the augmentation data, is the critical field involved here. An attacker can craft this field in such a way that, when the 'augmentation_data_len' is added to the 'start' pointer (which points to the current position in the augmentation data processing), it causes 'start' to overflow. As a result, the overflow can make the subsequent check ('start >= end') inadequate for detecting that the 'start' pointer has moved past the 'end' pointer of the buffer. This manipulation could lead the program into processing data outside of the intended memory area, leading to a heap-based buffer over-read and potentially crashing the application (denial of service) or having other unintended effects.

Thus, the specific ELF related field involved in invoking this CVE is the augmentation data length specified in the DWARF .debug_frame section's CIE or FDE records.
