Based on the clarification provided and revisiting the information about CVE-2017-16828, the specific issue of the 'start' variable potentially overflowing when 'augmentation_data_len' is added—thus bypassing the 'start >= end' check—can be directly associated with how GNU Binutils handles the augmentation data within Call Frame Information (CFI) entries of ELF files.

### ELF Field Related to CVE-2017-16828:

In ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) files, the Debugging Information Entry (DIE) contains Call Frame Information (CFI) that is crucial for unwinding the stack and debugging. This CFI is part of what is known as DWARF debugging information.

- **Augmentation Data in CFI**: The specific ELF field that would invoke CVE-2017-16828 is the Augmentation Data Length field within the CFI records. In the schema of DWARF information, augmentation data provides additional information about the frame’s layout or instructions for more exotic architectures or circumstances.

### How the Augmentation Data Length Field Invokes CVE-2017-16828:

Let's extract and elaborate on the specific mechanism:

1. **CFI Parsing**: When Binutils' tools (like `objdump`, `readelf`, etc.) process ELF files, they parse the CFI for debugging purposes. During this parsing, these tools encounter augmentation data associated with CIE (Common Information Entry) or FDE (Frame Description Entry).

2. **Augmentation Data Length Parsing**: The vulnerability occurs when reading the length of the augmentation data. If the length is crafted to trigger an overflow when added to the 'start' pointer (which points to the current location in the augmentation data), it can bypass the subsequent 'start >= end' check. Essentially, a very large or specifically crafted length causes `start + augmentation_data_len` to wrap around, undershooting 'end', wrongly indicating that the pointer is within the bounds of the allocated memory.

3. **Memory Corruption Risk**: This bypass can lead to out-of-bounds memory access, potentially causing a crash (denial of service) or leading to a situation where memory is interpreted incorrectly—resulting from either an over-read (leading to information leak/disclosure) or even more severe impacts depending on how the corrupted memory is used subsequently in the Binutils processing logic.

In summary, specifically manipulated Augmentation Data Length fields within the CFI of ELF files can exploit CVE-2017-16828, due to how GNU Binutils performs arithmetic operations and checks on this field without adequately safeguarding against integer overflow, leading to memory safety issues.
