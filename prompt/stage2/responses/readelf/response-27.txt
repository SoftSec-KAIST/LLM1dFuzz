Based on the clarification, the root cause of CVE-2017-16828 indeed centers on the scenario where the 'start' variable could overflow after adding 'augmentation_data_len', which would allow bypassing the validity check 'start >= end'. This occurs when handling augmentation data associated with Call Frame Information (CFI) records within ELF files' debug sections, specifically in the handling of DWARF debugging information.

DWARF is a widely-used format for debugging data in ELF files, and it contains a range of different data sections, one of which is `.debug_frame`. This section contains Call Frame Information (CFI) that debuggers use to unwind stacks and decode call frames for showing backtraces, among other uses.

The ELF field related to this vulnerability is within the `.debug_frame` section or its equivalent used in Exception Handling Frames (EH Frames) represented in section `.eh_frame`. These sections contain CIE (Common Information Entry) and FDE (Frame Description Entry) records. The augmentation data, part of CIE records, is intended to provide additional information that can affect the interpretation of CFI instructions.

As described in the provided patch and analysis, a crafted ELF file could specify an overly large `augmentation_data_len` (even leading to overflow when added to the `start` pointer) which is supposed to denote the length of augmentation data following the CIE or FDE records. Without proper validation (checking that `augmentation_data_len` is sensible relative to the remaining space in the buffer), malicious augmentation data lengths could be used to cause an overflow of the `start` pointer. This overflow may subsequently allow the check `start >= end` (meant to ensure that the reading process doesn't attempt to access beyond the allocated buffer) to be bypassed, leading to out-of-bounds reads or more severe impacts depending on the context where the overflow occurs.

In summary, the ELF fields related to invoking this CVE are found in the augmentation data lengths specified in CIE records within the `.debug_frame` or `.eh_frame` sections. These sections and their handling in GNU Binutils were improperly checking for overflow conditions, specifically after arithmetic operations on pointer variables in relation to these lengths, which could lead to severe vulnerabilities when processing specially crafted ELF files.
