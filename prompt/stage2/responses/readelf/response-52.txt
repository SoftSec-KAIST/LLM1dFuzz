Based on the clarification provided and revisiting the details surrounding CVE-2017-16828, if the root cause is the potential for the 'start' variable to overflow after adding 'augmentation_data_len', then this specifically points to the handling of Dwarf Debug Frame information, more specifically to the augmentation data within the Common Information Entry (CIE) or Frame Description Entry (FDE) in the ELF file's Dwarf debug sections.

In ELF files, Dwarf debug information is stored in sections like `.debug_frame`, `.eh_frame`, etc. These sections contain CIEs and FDEs that describe how to unwind the stack and how the frames relate to each other. The augmentation data within a CIE or an FDE can include various forms of additional information, not defined in the standard itself but rather expected to be interpreted by specific implementations or for specific purposes (like exception handling).

The field that directly relates to invoking this CVE would be the length field of the augmentation data within a CIE or an FDE's data structure in these sections. When an ELF file is crafted with incorrect or maliciously large values in this length field, it could lead to 'start' variable overflow. The code that reads this length does not adequately check for overflow conditions before using this value to calculate memory addresses or lengths for buffer reads. This incorrect calculation can cause the 'start >= end' validity check to be bypassed if 'start + augmentation_data_len' wraps around, leading to memory safety violations such as buffer over-reads.

To summarize, the ELF field related to invoking CVE-2017-16828 is the augmentation data length field within the CIE/FDE structures in the `.debug_frame` or `.eh_frame` sections, which, if maliciously crafted, can result in an integer overflow affecting the safety checks and potentially leading to the exploitation of this vulnerability.
