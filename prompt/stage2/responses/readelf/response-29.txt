Given the clarification, the root cause of CVE-2017-16828 indeed revolves around the potential for the 'start' pointer to overflow when 'augmentation_data_len' is added. This overflow could cause the subsequent validity check ('start >= end') to fail improperly, allowing execution to continue with a corrupted 'start' value that does not truly reflect the file's contents or structure. This could lead to a heap-based buffer over-read or even application crash, depending on how the corrupted pointer is subsequently used.

The specific field in the ELF that is related to triggering this CVE is the augmentation data within the DWARF debugging information. DWARF is a widely used format for debugging data in ELF files. The augmentation data is an optional part of the DWARF Call Frame Information (CFI), stored in `.debug_frame` sections (and possibly in `.eh_frame` sections for exception handling information on some systems). This data contains additional information that can vary between compilers and debugger needs.

Triggering the vulnerability would require crafting an ELF file with corrupted DWARF CFI augmentation data that, when processed, causes an integer overflow in the computation of the 'start' pointer's position. This crafted CFI augmentation data might have an anomalously large or specially designed 'augmentation_data_len' value that exploits the lack of proper bound and overflow checks prior to accessing memory based on the computed position, which directly relates to the exploitation of this CVE.

As a specific field of interest, the `augmentation_data_len` directly influences the overflow since it's this length that gets improperly added to the 'start' pointer without adequate overflow checks, making it a pivotal point for exploitation. Properly crafted, malicious ELF files could manipulate these fields to cause the described denial of service or potentially lead to further unspecified impacts by exploiting the improper handling of this augmentation data length.
