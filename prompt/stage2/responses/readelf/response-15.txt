Based on the clarification provided, the root cause of CVE-2017-16828 is indeed related to the possibility that the 'start' variable could overflow when 'augmentation_data_len' is added to it. This could happen if 'augmentation_data_len' is significantly large, causing 'start' to wrap around and potentially bypass the validity check ('start >= end'), leading to an integer overflow. This overflow might allow for read operations past the buffer's end, constituting a heap-based buffer over-read and possibly causing a denial of service (application crash) or other unspecified impacts.

Given the nature of the vulnerability and the context of the provided patch, the ELF field related to invoking this CVE is associated with the augmentation data length within the Call Frame Information (CFI) entries of the `.debug_frame` or the `.eh_frame` sections. These sections are part of the DWARF debugging information in ELF binaries, which can include augmentation data to provide additional information about exception handling or other aspects pertinent to debugging.

The Call Frame Information entries, which include Common Information Entries (CIEs) and Frame Description Entries (FDEs), can contain augmentation data specified by an augmentation string. The length of this augmentation data is serialized in the ELF file using the ULEB128 (Unsigned Little Endian Base 128) variable-length encoding format. Vulnerabilities like CVE-2017-16828 are triggered when parsing these lengths from malformed or malicious ELF files, especially when the software does not adequately check the resulting 'start + augmentation_data_len' calculation against overflow conditions or the logical end of the buffer ('end'). 

Thus, the specific ELF fields related to this vulnerability are within the augmentation data lengths (specified as ULEB128 values) of the CIE or FDE records in the `.debug_frame` or `.eh_frame` sections. These fields, if improperly validated, can lead to the described security issue when processing corrupt or maliciously crafted ELF binaries.
