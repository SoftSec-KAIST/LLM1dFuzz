Based on the clarification provided, the root cause of CVE-2017-16828 involves an oversight in the validation logic that fails to account for potential integer overflow. Specifically, after adding the `augmentation_data_len` to the `start` pointer, if an overflow occurs, it can cause the validation check `start >= end` to be bypassed. This flaw can lead to heap-based buffer over-read scenarios, where the program attempts to read data past the intended buffer, causing crashes or other unintended behaviors.

The ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) field related to invoking this CVE is likely related to the DWARF debug information, more specifically the augmentation data length within the Common Information Entry (CIE) or Frame Description Entry (FDE) of the `.debug_frame` section. DWARF is a standard for representing debugging information in binary files, and GNU Binutils uses this information for various debugging tasks. 

Augmentation data in CIE or FDE sections can contain additional information used by DWARF consumers to provide more context or control how stack frames are interpreted. The length of this data is specified in the ELF file, and if this length is maliciously crafted to induce an integer overflow when added to the `start` pointer, it could bypass bounds checks meant to ensure that reading this augmentation data does not go past the end of the buffer allocated for the `.debug_frame` section.

To summarize, the ELF field related to this CVE involves the augmentation data length values within the DWARF CIE or FDE entries in the `.debug_frame` section. Maliciously crafted values in these fields can exploit the integer overflow vulnerability described.
