Given the clarification that the root cause of CVE-2017-16828 is related to the bypass of the validity check `start >= end` due to potential overflow when `augmentation_data_len` is added to `start`, we can infer that the vulnerability specifically involves the handling of augmentation data within ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) files.

Based on the context provided and common knowledge about ELF formats and how dwarf debug data is encoded within them, the field within ELF files that is related to invoking this CVE is likely involved in the debug information sections, specifically within the `.debug_frame` or similar sections that contain Call Frame Information (CFI) entries. These entries provide the necessary information for a debugger to unwind the call stack, and they consist of Common Information Entries (CIE) and Frame Description Entries (FDE). Each CIE or FDE has an associated length field that indicates the size of the CIE or FDE, and augmentation data can be part of this. 

The augmentation data length (`augmentation_data_len`) is read from the ELF file, and if this length is maliciously crafted to exploit the integer overflow vulnerability, it can cause the `start` pointer arithmetic to overflow. This in turn could bypass the validity check (`start >= end`) wrongly indicating that the pointer is still within the bounds of the allocated buffer for the CIE/FDE data, leading to heap-based buffer over-read or other unintended behavior.

Thus, the specific ELF field triggering the CVE during the parsing of DWARF debug information is the length field of augmentation data contained within the Debug Frame information entries (CIE/FDE entries). This length improperly handled can lead to exploitation of this vulnerability.
