Based on the corrected context, the root cause of CVE-2016-10269 actually involves the handling of the 'bits per sample' field (`td->td_bitspersample`) in TIFF images without proper validity checks before its use.

In detail, the CVE description and the associated patch suggest that the vulnerability is exploited through crafted TIFF images that, when processed, misuse or misinterpret the `td->td_bitspersample` field due to a lack of appropriate validation or handling. Such inadequate handling potentially leads to heap-based buffer over-reads or overflows, as the program might allocate insufficient heap memory for processing the image data based on the unvalidated `td->td_bitspersample` value. 

Given this corrected understanding, the TIFF field related to invoking CVE-2016-10269 is the 'bits per sample' field, which specifies the number of bits per component. This field is crucial for understanding the format and depth of the image data. Any manipulation or incorrect handling—particularly when the TIFF image is crafted to exploit this flaw—can lead to the aforementioned security vulnerability.
