Based on the correction and the detailed examination of the patches and description provided earlier, the specific field in TIFF related to invoking CVE-2016-10269 is the `BitsPerSample` field. 

The vulnerability arises from the hardcoded modifications to the `td->td_bitspersample` without proper validity checks. When processing TIFF files, especially while handling compressed data formats like PixarLog or LUV, the code modifications during the close process of an image (as seen in both `LogLuvClose` and `PixarLogClose` functions) adjust the `td->td_bitspersample` irresponsibly. This manipulation, which aims to make the TIFF file compatible or readable by other software, doesn't include checks to ensure that such adjustments do not lead to out-of-bounds memory access, particularly when the file is structured in a certain way, utilizing specific features such as `TransferFunction` tied to `BitsPerSample`.

This issue points out the significance of the `BitsPerSample` field, as it dictates the amount of memory allocated for pixel sample data. Without verifying the correctness and compatibility of its value relative to the rest of the file's structure and the state of the encoder, attackers can craft TIFF files that, when processed by the vulnerable LibTIFF code, lead to heap-based buffer over-reads or overflow conditions, representing the core of the CVE-2016-10269 vulnerability.
