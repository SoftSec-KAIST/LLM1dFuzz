Based on the correction and the information provided, the field in TIFF that is related to invoking CVE-2016-10269 is 'BitsPerSample'. The vulnerability was due to the hardcoded value of `td->td_bitspersample` being used without a validity check in scenarios where maliciously crafted input could lead to a heap-based buffer overflow. The issue arose specifically in the context of handling compressed TIFF images with PixarLog and LUV compression schemes, where the manipulation or "nasty plays" with `BitsPerSample` could trigger the vulnerability.
