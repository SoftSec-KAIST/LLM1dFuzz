The field in ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) related to invoking CVE-2017-8393 is primarily the `sh_type` field of the section header. This field specifies the type of the section, with `SHT_REL` and `SHT_RELA` being the types of interest for this vulnerability. These `sh_type` values indicate sections containing relocation information, which are essential for dynamic linking and address resolution.

The vulnerability arises from the erroneous assumption in the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library that sections of types `SHT_REL` (Relocation entries without explicit addends) and `SHT_RELA` (Relocation entries with explicit addends) are always named starting with a `.rel` or `.rela` prefix, respectively. This belief led to incorrect handling of such sections based purely on naming conventions, leading to a global buffer over-read when the code encounters a section named differently from the expected norm.

Thus, while the `sh_type` field itself is not the direct cause of the vulnerability, the way the BFD library's code interprets and processes sections based on their `sh_type` in conjunction with their names leads to the exploitation scenario of CVE-2017-8393. The vulnerable code improperly manages the association between section names and their types, specifically around relocation sections, thereby creating the conditions for this security issue when parsing and processing ELF files.
