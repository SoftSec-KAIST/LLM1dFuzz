The field in ELF files that is related to invoking CVE-2017-8393 is the section name of SHT_REL/SHT_RELA sections. The vulnerability was specifically triggered by the handling of these sections' names in the GNU Binutils' libbfd library. The incorrect assumption that these section names always start with a .rel/.rela prefix led to a global buffer over-read error. This means that any ELF file containing SHT_REL or SHT_RELA sections with names not adhering to the expected naming convention (.rel/.rela prefix) could potentially trigger this vulnerability when processed by affected versions of tools like objcopy and strip that rely on the libbfd library.
