The field in ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) related to invoking CVE-2017-8393 is primarily the **section name** as referenced within the Section Header Table (SHT). Specifically, the vulnerability is related to the handling of SHT_REL and SHT_RELA section types, which correspond to relocation entries. The issue arises from the incorrect assumption that these sections always start with a `.rel` or `.rela` prefix in their names.

Each section in an ELF file has an entry in the Section Header Table, which includes information like the section name, section type, size, and other attributes. The section name itself is stored in a separate section, commonly known as the string table (`.shstrtab`), and the section header entry for each section contains an offset into this string table. It is this field—the offset into the string table pointing to the section name—that is directly related to the vulnerability. The logic that processes these section names (based on the flawed assumption about naming conventions) leads to the erroneous handling of SHT_REL and SHT_RELA sections when their names do not match the expected naming pattern, thereby causing the buffer over-read issues described in CVE-2017-8393. 

The vulnerability manifests during operations by tools (`objcopy`, `strip`, etc.) that use libbfd for ELF manipulation when they operate on relocation sections whose names do not strictly follow the `.rel`/`.rela` naming convention, relying on the flawed logic to identify related sections based on their names. This incorrect handling based on the section name field is at the core of the vulnerability.
