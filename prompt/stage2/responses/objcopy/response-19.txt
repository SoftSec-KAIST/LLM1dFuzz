The field in ELF files related to invoking CVE-2017-8393 is the section header type, specifically the `sh_type` field for sections designated as SHT_REL or SHT_RELA. This vulnerability arises from the handling of these section types, where the assumption was that their names always start with ".rel" or ".rela" prefixes. The `sh_type` field in the section header of an ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) file indicates the type of the section, and in the context of this vulnerability, sections of type SHT_REL and SHT_RELA (which denote relocation sections) are the focal point.

Relocation sections contain information necessary to adjust symbol addresses based on their final locations in memory, which is vital for the dynamic linking process. The incorrect handling of the names of these sections, based on the assumption about their prefixes, leads to a global buffer over-read issue when the actual section names do not conform to the expected naming convention, thus triggering the vulnerability described in CVE-2017-8393.
