The CVE-2017-8393 vulnerability is related to the way relocation sections, specifically SHT_REL and SHT_RELA sections, are handled in ELF files by the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library within GNU Binutils. Relocation sections contain information necessary to adjust symbol references once the actual memory addresses are determined. The field in the ELF format specifically related to invoking this CVE would be the section type fields (`sh_type`) for relocation entries, namely:

- `SHT_REL`: This denotes a relocation section with explicit addends. Relocation entries in such sections specify adjustments that need to be made to code or data in the executable, without any added data to represent the full value.
- `SHT_RELA`: This denotes a relocation section with addends. Entries in these sections include both an offset where the adjustment needs to be made and the addend, which represents the value to be added to the symbol's actual address as part of the relocation process.

Both of these section types are meant to be processed by tools like `objcopy` and `strip` in a way that respects their contents to adjust symbol addresses based on the actual memory layout. The vulnerability was due to assumptions about the naming conventions of these sections (expecting them to start with `.rel` or `.rela`), leading to a global buffer over-read error when such assumptions do not hold, thus affecting the stability of the tools that analyze or manipulate ELF files relying on the libbfd library.
