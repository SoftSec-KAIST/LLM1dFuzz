The field in ELF files related to invoking CVE-2017-8393 is the section name field for the SHT_REL and SHT_RELA section types. The vulnerability stemmed from an incorrect assumption in the handling code that these sections' names would always start with a ".rel" or ".rela" prefix. The faulty logic related to accessing these names caused a global buffer over-read when encountering section names that did not conform to this expectation.

In the context of ELF files, sections of types SHT_REL and SHT_RELA are used for relocation information, specifying how to adjust symbol references in the executable or shared object file when loaded into memory. The issue was specifically tied to how the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library processed these sections based on their names, leading to potential crashes of tools like `objcopy` and `strip` that rely on libbfd for manipulating ELF files. The patch corrected this by altering how relocation sections are identified and handled, removing the unsafe assumption about their naming convention.
