The field in the ELF format related to invoking CVE-2017-8393 is the section header type, specifically `sh_type`, for sections of type `SHT_REL` and `SHT_RELA`. These types represent relocation sections within an ELF file, which contain entries that describe how to adjust symbol references either within the same ELF file or across shared libraries. The vulnerability was due to the assumption in the GNU Binutils' Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library that all such sections would be named with a `.rel` or `.rela` prefix, an assumption that does not hold in all cases.

Relocation sections (`SHT_REL` and `SHT_RELA`) are crucial for dynamically linking executables and libraries, as they tell the linker/loader how to modify symbol addresses based on where sections are loaded in memory. The CVE arises from mismanaging these sections due to their names not always adhering to the expected naming convention, leading to buffer over-read issues in tools like `objcopy` and `strip` that use the libbfd library for processing ELF files.
