The field in ELF files that is related to invoking CVE-2017-8393 is the section header type, specifically the types SHT_REL and SHT_RELA, which denote relocation sections. The vulnerability manifests in the handling of the names of these sections. In ELF files, each section has a type and a name, and the issue stems from the assumption in the GNU Binutils libbfd code that sections of types SHT_REL/SHT_RELA always have names starting with the ".rel" or ".rela" prefixes. 

The handling of these section types without properly verifying the section names leads to a global buffer over-read error, as the code incorrectly determines which sections the relocations apply to based on their names. Thus, it is the management of the ELF file's relocation sections (SHT_REL, SHT_RELA) and their associated names in the section headers that are directly related to triggering this vulnerability.
