The field in ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) related to invoking CVE-2017-8393 is primarily the `sh_type` field of the section headers, specifically when it holds the values corresponding to `SHT_REL` (Section Header Table Relocation entries without addends) or `SHT_RELA` (Section Header Table Relocation entries with addends). 

In ELF files, each section of the file has a header associated with it, described by an `Elf_Shdr` structure. The `sh_type` field of this structure describes the section's content and semantics. For the vulnerability in question, the handling—or rather, the mishandling—of sections with the types `SHT_REL` and `SHT_RELA` is central. The issue arises due to the incorrect assumption that these sections' names must start with ".rel" or ".rela", leading to a buffer over-read when sections are named differently. 

The vulnerability manifests during operations performed by binary analysis and manipulation tools like `objcopy` and `strip`, which interact with these relocation sections under the assumption of naming conventions that are not upheld, thereby triggering the bug when encountering unexpected section names.

Hence, while the problematic assumption is about the section names (which are not directly a field like `sh_type` but are stored as strings pointed to by `sh_name` index into the section header string table), the types of sections leading to this vulnerability are indeed identified by the `sh_type` field in their ELF section headers.
