The field in ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) files related to invoking CVE-2017-8393 is the section header type for relocation sections, specifically `SHT_REL` and `SHT_RELA`. These types denote sections containing relocation information, essential for correctly linking symbolic references to their corresponding addresses when a program is loaded into memory.

The vulnerability was due to an erroneous assumption in how these sections, `SHT_REL` and `SHT_RELA`, were named and subsequently handled by the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library. Specifically, the library assumed that these sections must start with a `.rel`/`.rela` prefix in their names. This incorrect assumption caused a global buffer over-read when the software encountered relocation sections that did not adhere to the expected naming convention, leading to crashes in applications utilizing the libbfd library for binary analysis, such as `objcopy` and `strip`.
