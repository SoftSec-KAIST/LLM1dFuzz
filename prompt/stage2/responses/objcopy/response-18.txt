The field in ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) files that is related to invoking CVE-2017-8393 is the section name field for SHT_REL and SHT_RELA sections. In ELF files, these sections contain relocation information, and their names typically start with `.rel` or `.rela` followed by the name of the section to which the relocations apply.

The vulnerability arises because the GNU Binutils BFD library made an incorrect assumption that these sections' names always follow this naming convention (`.rel`/`.rela` prefix). This assumption led to a global buffer over-read error when the BFD library processed ELF files with SHT_REL/SHT_RELA sections not adhering to the expected naming pattern. As a result, tools relying on this library for binary analysis, such as `objcopy` and `strip`, could crash when dealing with such malformed or uncommonly named sections.

The core of the issue was in the handling of the section name matching and assumptions within the library's code rather than a specific field in the ELF header directly. However, the field involved indirectly is the `sh_name` field in the section header, which contains the offset in the section header string table section (`.shstrtab`) pointing to the name of the section. The handling of this `sh_name` value and its associated string in the context of SHT_REL and SHT_RELA sections was where the erroneous assumption and thus the vulnerability occurred.
