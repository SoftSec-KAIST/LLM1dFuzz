The field in the ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) file related to invoking CVE-2017-8393 is primarily associated with the types of sections that handle relocation entries, specifically the `sh_type` field in the section headers that indicates the type of the section. For this particular CVE, the relevant `sh_type` values are `SHT_REL` and `SHT_RELA`, which stand for relocation entries without and with explicit addends, respectively.

Relocation entries are used to adjust code and data references in a program during the linking process or, in the case of shared libraries and dynamic loading, at runtime. The erroneous assumption in the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library was that sections intended for relocation entries (`SHT_REL` and `SHT_RELA`) always have their names starting with `.rel`/`.rela`. However, there is no strict requirement in the ELF specification mandating such naming conventions for sections. This CVE arises from the handling (or mishandling) of these sections based on their names rather than purely on their `sh_type` values or other more reliable identifiers.

The mishandling of section names versus the types of sections described by `sh_type` led to the incorrect processing of ELF files, where the BFD library code would wrongly anticipate the structure of sections and thus cause buffer over-read issues, potentially leading to application crashes. This vulnerability was patched by updating the libbfd code to remove the incorrect assumption about section names and instead correctly identify and process relocation sections based on reliable attributes, not merely by their names.
