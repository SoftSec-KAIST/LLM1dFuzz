The field in ELF related to invoking CVE-2017-8393 is the section header's name (`sh_name`) for SHT_REL/SHR_RELA sections. The vulnerability originates from the assumption that the names of these sections start with a `.rel`/`.rela` prefix. This flawed assumption is then used in the context of parsing and handling these sections in the libbfd library, which is part of the GNU Binutils suite.

In ELF files, the section header (`sh_name`) is an index into the section header string table section, which contains the names of all the sections. The handling of SHT_REL and SHT_RELA sections, which contain relocation information, incorrectly expected these names to adhere to a naming convention that was not guaranteed or enforced by the ELF specification.

The patch addressing CVE-2017-8393 modifies the way these section names are processed, removing the faulty assumption about the naming convention. Instead of expecting the `.rel` or `.rela` prefix and potentially causing a buffer over-read error when such an assumption is violated, the corrected code dynamically identifies the target section for relocations based on the actual section names without relying on the prefix assumption. This approach ensures more robust and specification-compliant handling of ELF sections, preventing crashes and other issues associated with the incorrect handling of section names.
