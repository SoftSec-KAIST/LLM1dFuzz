The field in the ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) related to invoking CVE-2017-8393 is **sh_type**, which specifies the section type in the section header. This vulnerability specifically concerns sections with the types **SHT_REL** and **SHT_RELA**, which represent relocation information.

The root cause of the vulnerability arises from the assumption within the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library, a part of GNU Binutils, that sections of type **SHT_REL** and **SHT_RELA** always have names starting with `.rel` or `.rela`, respectively. This assumption leads to a global buffer over-read error when the library encounters a section of these types that does not follow the expected naming convention, as the code incorrectly calculates memory bounds based on these prefixes.

In summary, the connection to the ELF field is through the **sh_type** field in section headers, which indicates the presence of relocation sections (**SHT_REL** and **SHT_RELA**). The mishandling of these section types, based on their names, is what leads to the vulnerability.
