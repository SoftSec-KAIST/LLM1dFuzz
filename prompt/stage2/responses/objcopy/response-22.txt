The field in the ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) related to invoking CVE-2017-8393 is specifically related to the handling of relocation sections, which are identified by their section type fields `SHT_REL` and `SHT_RELA` within the ELF file structure. The vulnerability is triggered due to assumptions made about the naming conventions of these sections (expecting them to start with `.rel` or `.rela` prefix) when processed by the affected versions of the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library.

In an ELF file, each section header has a `sh_type` field that specifies the section's content and semantics. For relocation sections, the `sh_type` can be `SHT_REL` for sections with explicit addends or `SHT_RELA` for sections with implicit addends. The issue arises because the BFD library's handling code for `objcopy` and `strip` did not correctly handle situations where the section names did not adhere to the expected naming conventions based on these `sh_type` fields.

To be more specific, the vulnerability does not directly relate to a single ELF field but rather to the logic in the BFD library that processes sections based on their `sh_type` (determining they are relocation sections) and then making further assumptions about their names (`sh_name` field in the section header). The flaw is in the handling logic upon these fields rather than the fields themselves being directly implicated in the vulnerability.
