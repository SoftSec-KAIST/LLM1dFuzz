The field in ELF related to invoking CVE-2017-8393 is the section name field for SHT_REL and SHT_RELA sections. The vulnerability was specifically due to assumptions made regarding the names of these relocation sections, where the problematic code expected these names to always begin with a `.rel` or `.rela` prefix. This is tied to how the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library, as distributed in GNU Binutils, processes ELF filesâ€”particularly the sections that contain relocation information.

Relocation sections (SHT_REL and SHT_RELA) contain entries that describe how to modify symbol references within executable or object code. The issue arises in the logic that attempts to match these relocation sections to their corresponding data sections by looking at their names. Since the flawed assumption was made that these names follow a fixed naming convention, when this assumption did not hold, it led to a global buffer over-read error because the code would incorrectly calculate offsets or sizes based on the expected names.

In summary, the critical link to this CVE is the handling of the section name field for SHT_REL and SHT_RELA sections within ELF files by the BFD library's code, particularly in utilities like `objcopy` and `strip` that process binary files.
