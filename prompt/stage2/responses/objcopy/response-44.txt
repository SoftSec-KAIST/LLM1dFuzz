The field in ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) related to invoking CVE-2017-8393 is primarily concerned with the type of relocation sections, which is denoted by `sh_type` in the section header. Specifically, the issue involves sections of types `SHT_REL` and `SHT_RELA`, indicating relocation entries without addends and with addends, respectively.

The vulnerability arises from the handling or interpretation of these types in conjunction with the section names. The original code made an incorrect assumption that the names of sections containing these types of relocations would always start with `.rel` or `.rela`. This assumption isUnsafe because it overlooks the flexibility of section naming within the ELF standard, potentially leading to a global buffer over-read when the code encounters a differently named section of these types.

Hence, while `sh_type` (indicating whether a section contains `SHT_REL` or `SHT_RELA` relocations) is directly related to the technical mechanism of the vulnerability, the broader issue stems from how the libbfd library's associated handling code interacts with section names, which do not strictly adhere to the expected naming convention.
