The field in ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) related to invoking CVE-2017-8393 is the `sh_type` field of the section header. This field indicates the type of the section. The vulnerability specifically pertains to sections of type `SHT_REL` and `SHT_RELA`, which are used for storing relocation information. The flawed assumption in the GNU Binutils' BFD library was that sections intended for relocation information (`SHT_REL`/`SHT_RELA`) are always named with prefixes `.rel`/`.rela`, influencing how these sections' names were handled in the code.

Relocation sections (`SHT_REL` and `SHT_RELA`) contain entries that describe how to modify the binary code and data to adjust for different memory address spaces once the program is loaded. The `sh_type` field is part of the ELF section header, a structure that includes metadata about the section, such as its name, size, and type. The incorrect handling based on the `sh_type` and the associated assumption about section names led to the buffer over-read vulnerability described in CVE-2017-8393. This vulnerability affected tools like `objcopy` and `strip`, which use the libbfd library to process ELF files, by causing these tools to crash when they encountered relocation sections not adhering to the naming assumption.
