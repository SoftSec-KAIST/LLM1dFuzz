The CVE-2017-8393 vulnerability specifically involves the handling of ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) section names, particularly those related to SHT_REL and SHT_RELA section types, which are used for relocation entries in ELF binaries. The crucial field in ELF that is related to invoking this CVE is the section name field in the section headers, which identifies the name of each section in the binary.

In ELF, each section header has an associated section name that is stored in a separate string table section, typically named `.shstrtab`. The section names are then indexed by the `sh_name` field in the section headers. The vulnerability arises from the incorrect assumption within the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library that sections of types SHT_REL and SHT_RELA (which indicate relocation sections) always have names beginning with `.rel` or `.rela`, respectively. This flawed assumption is related to how these section names are processed and mapped to their corresponding sections that they apply to for relocation purposes.

The patch that addresses CVE-2017-8393 modifies how the BFD library interprets these section names, particularly changing how it matches relocation sections to the sections they refer to, thus making the processing of section names more robust and not dependent on the `.rel`/`.rela` prefix assumption. This change directly affects the handling and interpretation of the `sh_name` field for sections within ELF files when being processed by tools like `objcopy` and `strip`, which rely on libbfd.
