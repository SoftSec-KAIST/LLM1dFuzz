The field in ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) files that is related to invoking CVE-2017-8393 is the section type, specifically the `sh_type` fields that indicate a section is of type SHT_REL or SHT_RELA. These `sh_type` fields are part of the section header table in ELF files, and they specify the type of the section, with SHT_REL and SHT_RELA being types for relocation information. 

The vulnerability was specifically related to the handling of these relocation sections (SHT_REL/SHR_RELA) and the incorrect assumption that their names always start with a .rel/.rela prefix. The flawed assumption in the handling logic for these `sh_type` fields (SHT_REL/SHT_RELA) led to a global buffer over-read when the expected naming convention was not met.

ELF relocation sections contain entries that describe how to modify code or data to account for changes in memory during execution or loading, with SHT_REL and SHT_RELA representing different formats for this information. The handling logic for these sections in the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library, as it failed to accurately verify the existence/correctness of these section names based on the `sh_type`, directly leads to the issues described in CVE-2017-8393.
