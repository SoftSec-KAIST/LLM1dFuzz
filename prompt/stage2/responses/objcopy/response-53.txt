The vulnerability CVE-2017-8393 in the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library, as identified in the GNU Binutils 2.28, is directly related to handling ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) section types, particularly SHT_REL and SHT_RELA, which are used for relocation entries. The issue manifests in the way these section types' names are processed.

The specific ELF-related field that gets involved in invoking this CVE is the section name field for SHT_REL (relocations without addends) and SHT_RELA (relocations with addends) sections. The vulnerability stems from an incorrect assumption in the libbfd library that these sections' names must start with a `.rel` or `.rela` prefix. Therefore, it is the handling of the section names—which are stored in the section header string table and referenced in the section header's `sh_name` field—that leads to a global buffer over-read error.

In ELF files, each section header (described by the `Elf32_Shdr` or `Elf64_Shdr` structures, depending on the architecture) has a `sh_name` field. This field is an index into the section header string table section (`.shstrtab`), which holds the names of the sections. The flawed libbfd logic incorrectly expected all names of sections holding relocation information to conform to the naming pattern with `.rel`/`.rela` prefix, leading to potential mishandling when encountering sections named otherwise.

The patch addressing CVE-2017-8393 corrects this by altering how the library checks and relates relocation section names, ensuring that processing does not rely on an unsafe assumption about section naming conventions, and thus mitigating the vulnerability.
