The field in ELF files that is related to invoking CVE-2017-8393 is the section name field for SHT_REL and SHT_RELA section types. The vulnerability stems from the incorrect handling of these sections' names by the libbfd code, which assumes that the names of relocation sections (sections of types SHT_REL for relocations without explicit addends and SHT_RELA for relocations with explicit addends) always start with the prefixes ".rel" or ".rela".

ELF files (Executable and Linkable Format) contain a variety of sections, each serving different purposes like code (.text), data (.data), symbols table (.symtab), string table (.strtab), relocation information (.rel/.rela), etc. Section names are stored in a section header string table (usually .shstrtab), and each section header has an `sh_name` field which is an index to the location of the section's name within the section header string table.

The issue arises specifically due to code not properly handling sections whose `sh_name` values point to names not adhering to the expected naming convention for relocation sections. Since ELF section names are arbitrary and the specification doesn't enforce this naming convention, exploitation of this vulnerability could occur if an ELF file contains a relocation section named without the ".rel" or ".rela" prefix expected by the libbfd's faulty logic. This assumption leads to a global buffer over-read when libbfd attempts to find and process the relevant sections based on their names, thereby invoking the vulnerability discussed in CVE-2017-8393.
