The field in ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) files that is related to invoking CVE-2017-8393 is primarily the section type field that indicates whether a section is of type SHT_REL or SHT_RELA. These types represent relocation sections in an ELF binary, which contain information necessary to adjust the code and data to make the executable or shared object work after it is loaded into memory at an arbitrary base address.

This vulnerability revolves around the handling of these relocation sections, particularly based on their names. The bug stems from the incorrect assumption in the GNU Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library's code, which anticipated that all SHT_REL and SHT_RELA sections would always be named starting with a `.rel` or `.rela` prefix, respectively. The reliance on this naming convention led to a global buffer over-read issue when the library encountered relocation sections not adhering to this expected naming pattern.

Therefore, while the direct fields related to this vulnerability are the section type fields indicating SHT_REL and SHT_RELA types, the issue is triggered by the handling of the section names that do not follow the expected naming conventions. The vulnerability is activated in the context of how the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library processes these sections based on their names during the execution of programs like `objcopy` and `strip`, which use the libbfd to analyze or manipulate binary files.
