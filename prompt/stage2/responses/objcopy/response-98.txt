The field in ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) files closely related to invoking CVE-2017-8393 is the section header (specifically, the section type fields `sh_type` for SHT_REL and SHT_RELA) along with the section name. This CVE is fundamentally related to the handling of sections containing relocation information. 

In ELF files, sections are described by section headers, and each section has a type indicated by the `sh_type` field in its header. The types relevant to this CVE are SHT_REL and SHT_RELA, which represent relocation sections. These sections contain entries for relocating symbols once their addresses are known. The vulnerability specifically arises from the handling of these section types based on the presumption that their names adhere to a naming convention, starting with `.rel` or `.rela` prefixes.

The incorrect assumption in the GNU Binutils' BFD library was that all SHT_REL and SHT_RELA sections would have names starting with these prefixes. When the code tried to process a section with relocation information but without the expected name prefix, it could lead to a global buffer over-readâ€”because the logic for identifying and accessing the content of the relocation sections was improperly tied to these name prefixes.

Therefore, `sh_type` in directing the code towards sections meant for relocations and the section names themselves are closely related to the cause and potential exploitation of this CVE. Proper handling of these ELF attributes without making incorrect assumptions about section names is critical in preventing such vulnerabilities.
