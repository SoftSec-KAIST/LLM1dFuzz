The field in the ELF format that is related to invoking CVE-2017-8393 is the section name field used in `SHT_REL` and `SHT_RELA` sections. Specifically, the issue arises from the handling of these sections' names, which are expected to start with `.rel` or `.rela` prefixes. The vulnerability manifests because the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library's code for `objcopy` and `strip` tools incorrectly assumes that all relocation sections will adhere to this naming convention. This incorrect assumption leads to a global buffer over-read error when the library processes ELF files containing `SHT_REL` or `SHT_RELA` sections named differently, potentially causing application crashes.

In ELF files, section headers (`Elf32_Shdr` or `Elf64_Shdr` for 32-bit and 64-bit formats, respectively) contain a field called `sh_name`, which is an index into the section header string table. This `sh_name` field indicates the name of the section. The erroneous handling of this `sh_name` field's value for `SHT_REL` and `SHT_RELA` sections, based on the prefixed naming assumption, is the crux that leads to CVE-2017-8393.
