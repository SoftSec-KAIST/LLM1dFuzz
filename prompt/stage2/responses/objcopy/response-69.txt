The field in ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) related to invoking CVE-2017-8393 is primarily associated with the handling of relocation sections, specifically the `sh_type` field in the section header, where the types `SHT_REL` and `SHT_RELA` are pertinent. The vulnerability stems from how relocation sections, identified by their `sh_type` being either `SHT_REL` or `SHT_RELA`, are assumed to always have names starting with `.rel` or `.rela`.

In ELF, each section of a binary or object file has a header, described by the `Elf32_Shdr` or `Elf64_Shdr` structures depending on the architecture. One of the fields in this section header structure is `sh_type`, which indicates the section's content and semantics. The values `SHT_REL` and `SHT_RELA` for `sh_type` specify sections containing relocation information without and with explicit addends, respectively.

The crux of CVE-2017-8393's vulnerability lies in the mistaken assumption within GNU Binutils' `libbfd` library that these relocation sections (`SHT_REL`/`SHT_RELA`) would always have names that start with the prefixes `.rel` and `.rela`. This assumption led to a global buffer over-read when sections did not adhere to this naming convention, causing crashes in tools like `objcopy` and `strip` that rely on `libbfd` for parsing and modifying ELF files.

The patch for this issue removed the faulty assumption by changing the method of linking relocation sections to their corresponding target sections, ensuring that the relationship is correctly established based on the actual section content and organization, not merely the section name. This addressed the buffer over-read issue by properly identifying and handling relocation sections regardless of their naming.
