The field in the ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) specification related to the invocation of CVE-2017-8393 is primarily the section type field, specifically denoted by SHT_REL and SHT_RELA in the section headers. These section types represent relocation sections. The vulnerability was triggered by incorrect assumptions about the naming conventions of these relocation sections (SHT_REL for Relocation Entries without explicit addends and SHT_RELA for Relocation Entries with explicit addends).

Relocation sections in ELF files contain entries that describe how to modify symbol locations in the executable code and data sections, allowing dynamic linking and adjustments to symbol addresses at load or run time. The section type is specified in the section header (`sh_type` field) of an ELF file, indicating how the section should be interpreted. The assumption in the vulnerable GNU Binutils code was that the names of sections of these types (SHT_REL and SHT_RELA) always start with `.rel` or `.rela` respectively. This faulty assumption led to a global buffer over-read error because the code improperly processed section names, not aligning with this expectation.

In summary, the `sh_type` field in the section headers of an ELF file that denotes SHT_REL and SHT_RELA section types is closely related to invoking CVE-2017-8393. The incorrect handling of the section names based on the `sh_type` led to the vulnerability.
