The field in ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) related to invoking CVE-2017-8393 is the section name field for SHT_REL/SHR_RELA sections. This vulnerability is triggered when assumptions about the naming convention of these sections (that they always start with .rel or .rela) do not hold true. Normally, section names are used to identify the type and purpose of each section within an ELF file. The vulnerability arises in the context of how relocation sections (SHT_REL for Relocation Entries without explicit addends and SHT_RELA for Relocation Entries with explicit addends) are identified and processed based on their names.

In ELF, sections of type SHT_REL and SHT_RELA are used for storing relocation information. This information is crucial for the dynamic linking process, adjusting the addresses of symbols as the actual memory locations can only be determined at runtime. The faulty assumption in the code before the patch was that these sections' names follow a strict naming convention (.rel/.rela prefix), which is not enforced or guaranteed by the ELF specification. This led to a situation where, if a relocation section didn't adhere to this naming convention, the libbfd library's functions, such as those involved in the `objcopy` and `strip` utilities, could attempt to access data outside the bounds of their intended memory buffers, causing errors or crashes. The vulnerable code incorrectly attempts to map these section names to their target sections based solely on naming conventions, leading to a global buffer over-read when the convention is not followed.

The patch fixes this issue by adjusting how the software identifies the target section of relocation entries, making the process more flexible and not dependent on the section name prefix, thus addressing the vulnerability described by CVE-2017-8393.
