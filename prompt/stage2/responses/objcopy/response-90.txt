The field in ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) files related to invoking CVE-2017-8393 is the section header type, particularly the `sh_type` field for sections of type SHT_REL and SHT_RELA. This vulnerability is specifically related to how these relocation sections, which contain information necessary for adjusting symbol addresses, are handled based on their names.

Relocation sections in ELF files provide the information needed to relocate symbol references within the file. Each relocation section applies to a specific section of the binary, and the relocation entries within these sections specify adjustments that need to be made when symbols are moved to different addresses (such as during dynamic linking or when loading a binary into memory). The section header (`Elf_Shdr` for 32-bit binaries, or `Elf64_Shdr` for 64-bit) of each section contains the `sh_type` field, which identifies the section's type, including whether it is a relocation section (SHT_REL or SHT_RELA).

The problem described in CVE-2017-8393 arises from an erroneous assumption in libbfd that these relocation sections would always start with `.rel` or `.rela` prefixes in their names (`sh_name` field in the section header), which is not necessarily the case. Tools like `objcopy` and `strip`, which rely on libbfd to process ELF files, could therefore encounter unexpected behavior or crashes when encountering ELF files with relocation section names that do not follow this convention. The patch fixes this by changing how these sections are identified and handled, no longer relying on the section name prefix alone but instead more accurately determining the relevant section to which relocations apply.

In summary, the `sh_type` field, indicating SHT_REL and SHT_RELA section types, is related to this vulnerability because it defines the nature of the sections that were incorrectly handled due to assumptions about their names (`sh_name`).
