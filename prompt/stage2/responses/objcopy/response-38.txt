The field in the ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) related to invoking CVE-2017-8393 is primarily concerned with the section header table, specifically the `sh_type` field of the section header, which denotes the section's type, and the section names themselves. The affected types are `SHT_REL` and `SHT_RELA`, which are used for relocation entries with explicit addends (`SHT_RELA`) and without explicit addends (`SHT_REL`).

In an ELF file, each section has a header, which describes the section's size, alignment, and type, among other attributes. The `sh_type` field indicates the content and semantics of the section. The vulnerability is triggered by how the BFD library processes the names of sections of these types (`SHT_REL`, `SHT_RELA`) under the assumption that their names must start with `.rel` or `.rela`. This incorrect assumption led to a buffer over-read issue because the code did not properly handle cases where section names did not adhere to this expected naming convention.

When the BFD library, used in utilities like `objcopy` and `strip`, encounters a section with an `sh_type` of `SHT_REL` or `SHT_RELA`, it expects the section name to adhere to the naming convention (starting with `.rel`/`.rela`). This expectation is flawed and can lead to the aforementioned security vulnerability when processing specially crafted ELF files with sections named differently.

Thus, the attempt to dereference or process section names based on this incorrect assumption without verifying the actual section names against the contents of the ELF file can lead to vulnerabilities like CVE-2017-8393. The patch addresses this issue by improving the handling of section name identification, ensuring that the library correctly associates relocation sections to their relevant sections regardless of the naming convention.
