The field in the ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) that is related to invoking CVE-2017-8393 is the `sh_type` field of the ELF Section Header. This field indicates the type of the section, such as whether it contains relocation entries (without or with explicit addends) — essentially, whether the section is of type `SHT_REL` or `SHT_RELA`. 

The vulnerability arose because the code in the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library (libbfd), distributed with GNU Binutils, made an incorrect assumption about the naming of sections based on their `sh_type`. It assumed that sections of type `SHT_REL` or `SHT_RELA`, which contain relocation information, always started with the prefixes `.rel` or `.rela` in their names. This assumption led to a global buffer over-read issue, as the library would not correctly handle sections that did not adhere to this naming convention but still contained valid relocation entries.

To clarify, it's not the `sh_type` field itself that invokes the CVE but the mishandling of sections based on their `sh_type` (interpreted through their names) within the BFD library’s code that led to the vulnerability. The relationship between the `sh_type` field and invoking this CVE lies in how the software interprets and acts upon the data in sections designated as `SHT_REL` or `SHT_RELA`, improperly assuming naming conventions that lead to unsafe memory access operations.
