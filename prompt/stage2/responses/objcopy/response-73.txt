The field in ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) that is related to invoking CVE-2017-8393 is the section header type (sh_type) for the relocation sections, specifically SHT_REL and SHT_RELA. These fields represent relocation entries without and with explicit addends, respectively.

In the context of this vulnerability, the library made an incorrect assumption about the naming conventions of these sections, assuming they always started with ".rel" or ".rela". However, the real issue lies in how these `.rel` and `.rela` section headers (SHT_REL and SHT_RELA) were being identified and processed based on their names rather than correctly handling them according to their `sh_type` and mapping them to their target sections using a more reliable method that does not depend solely on naming conventions.

Thus, while the direct cause of the issue is the handling of the section names related to relocation entries, it is the `sh_type` field's definition of the section as being of type SHT_REL or SHT_RELA that is central to the vulnerability's context. The mishandling of these types based on name assumptions leads to the global buffer over-read error described in CVE-2017-8393.
