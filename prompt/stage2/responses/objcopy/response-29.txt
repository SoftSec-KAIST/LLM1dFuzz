The field in the ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) format that is related to invoking CVE-2017-8393 is primarily the section name field in the section headers. The vulnerability is due to incorrect assumptions about the naming of sections for SHT_REL and SHT_RELA types, which contain relocation information. In an ELF file, each section has a header that includes a field for the section name. This name is stored as an index into a section header string table (section names string table), which holds the names of all the sections in the ELF file.

The specific problem was the assumption in the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library (libbfd) that sections of the type SHT_REL (relocations without explicit addends) and SHT_RELA (relocations with explicit addends) would always have names starting with the `.rel` or `.rela` prefix, respectively. This assumption led to a buffer over-read issue when the library encountered section names that did not follow this convention, as the code attempted to access data beyond the allocated memory when processing the section name string, based on the assumed prefixes.

The patch for this vulnerability involved changing the handling of relocation sections to not rely solely on the section name prefixes to identify the applicable sections for relocations, thereby addressing the incorrect assumption and preventing the buffer over-read scenario.
