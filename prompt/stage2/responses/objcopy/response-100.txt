The field in ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) related to invoking CVE-2017-8393 is the section header type, specifically the `sh_type` field within the section headers that indicates the type of the section. The vulnerability specifically pertains to the handling of sections with the types `SHT_REL` and `SHT_RELA`, which represent relocation information. These section types are crucial for dynamic linking, describing how to modify code or data to incorporate the address information determined at runtime.

The incorrect assumption in the BFD library code was that these relocation sections (`SHT_REL`/`SHT_RELA`) would always be named with a prefix of `.rel` or `.rela`. The `sh_type` field is what identifies a section as containing relocation information, and the error occurred because, based solely on the `sh_type`, the code then expected a certain naming convention for these sections, leading to the buffer over-read issue when the naming did not match expectations.

The patch to fix CVE-2017-8393 addresses this by removing the reliance on the section names starting with `.rel` or `.rela` and instead correctly identifying and processing the relocation sections by their `sh_type` and content rather than their name, thus mitigating the vulnerability.
