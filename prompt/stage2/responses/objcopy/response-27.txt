The field in ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) files that is directly related to invoking CVE-2017-8393 is the section name field for sections of type SHT_REL or SHT_RELA, which are the relocation sections. These sections contain data that describe how to modify code and data for specific locations, making them critical for the linking process and for adjusting executable code during dynamic linking at runtime.

The vulnerability stems from an assumption in the GNU Binutils libbfd (Binary File Descriptor library) that these sections always have names starting with the prefixes `.rel` or `.rela`, respectively. This expectation is manifested when processing the section names in ELF files. The section name field for each section in an ELF file is located in the section header, and the names themselves are stored in the section header string table section (`.shstrtab`). The misuse or incorrect interpretation of these section name fields when handling SHT_REL/SHT_RELA sections can lead to the buffer over-read issue described in CVE-2017-8393.

To be more specific, the issue arises when the software attempts to find the section to which relocation applies by assuming the name of the relocation section (in the section header's name field) starts with a specific prefix. This assumption leads to incorrect processing when a binary file contains relocation sections that do not comply with this naming convention, ultimately causing a global buffer over-read error.

The patch provided to address this vulnerability involves modifying the way the libbfd library interprets and handles the names of SHT_REL and SHT_RELA sections, moving away from reliance on hardcoded name prefixes and towards a more robust mechanism for identifying the appropriate sections regardless of their names. This change impacts how the `elf_backend_get_reloc_section` function (and related code) processes the section name field in ELF section headers, improving the library's ability to handle a wider range of valid and malformed ELF files securely.
