The field in the ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) that is directly related to invoking CVE-2017-8393 is the section name field for relocation sections, specifically sections of type `SHT_REL` and `SHT_RELA`. The vulnerability was due to the incorrect assumption that these sections' names always start with the `.rel` or `.rela` prefix. In ELF files, each section has an associated name stored in the section header string table, which can be referenced by the section header's `sh_name` field. The `sh_name` field is an index into the section header string table section, holding the name of the section.

The issue arose from how the GNU Binutils' objcopy and strip utilities, through their use of the libbfd library, processed these relocation sections based solely on their names. The flawed assumption about the naming convention led to a global buffer over-read issue when encountering sections not adhering to the expected naming pattern, thereby triggering the vulnerability when these tools attempted to analyze or manipulate ELF files containing such sections.

The patch to address this CVE involved changing how relocation sections are identified and handled, removing the reliance on their names starting with a specific prefix and thereby mitigating the issue related to the misuse of the `sh_name` field values for these sections.
