The field in ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) related to invoking CVE-2017-8393 is the section name field within the section header table. Specifically, this vulnerability is associated with the handling of the names of SHT_REL and SHT_RELA section types, which store relocation information. The bug stems from the incorrect assumption that these sections always have names starting with a .rel or .rela prefix.

In ELF files, the section header table describes the file's sections' characteristics and locations. Each entry in this table corresponds to a section and includes various fields such as section name, type, flags, address, offset, size, link, info, address alignment, and entry size. The "name" field in this context is crucial because it points to a string in the section header string table containing the name of the section.

The vulnerability arises when tools like `objcopy` and `strip`, which rely on the BFD library, iterate over the ELF sections and apply specific logic based on the assumption about section names beginning with .rel/.rela. When encountering sections related to relocation (SHT_REL, SHT_RELA) that do not adhere to this naming convention, the tools experience a buffer over-read error, leading to crashes or undefined behavior. This is because the code erroneously assumes the presence of this prefix to determine how to process the section, thereby accessing memory beyond the intended buffer when such assumptions do not hold.

The patch for CVE-2017-8393 addresses this issue by changing the way these sections are identified and processed, ensuring that the reliance on the section name's prefix does not lead to incorrect memory access.
