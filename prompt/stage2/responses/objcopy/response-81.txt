The field in ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) files related to invoking CVE-2017-8393 is the section name field of SHT_REL/SHR_RELA sections. The vulnerability specifically stems from the incorrect assumption in the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library, as used in GNU Binutils 2.28, that these sectionsâ€™ names must always start with a `.rel`/`.rela` prefix. This assumption affects how the library, and consequently tools such as `objcopy` and `strip`, handle relocation sections by incorrectly predicting their names for processing. 

When these tools encounter SHT_REL (relocation) or SHR_RELA (relocation with addends) sections that do not follow this naming convention, they experience a global buffer over-read error due to the discrepancy between expected and actual memory layout dictated by the section names in the ELF files.

Hence, the exploitation of the CVE-2017-8393 vulnerability directly relates to how ELF files are structured, particularly the naming of sections involved in relocations, which is indicated in their section name fields in the ELF structure.
