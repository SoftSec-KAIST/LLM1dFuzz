The field in ELF related to invoking CVE-2017-8393 is primarily concerning how relocation sections (SHT_REL/SHR_RELA) are handled and named. In ELF files, each section has a name and type, among other attributes. The types SHT_REL and SHT_RELA represent relocation sections without and with explicit addends, respectively. The issue was with the assumptions made about the names of these sections, specifically that they would always start with the prefix `.rel`/`.rela`.

The ELF structure consists of various headers and sections, including:

- **ELF Header**: Provides overall information about the file's format, architecture, and system attributes.
- **Section Headers**: Describe the file's sections, specifying types, attributes, and locations. Sections may contain code, data, symbol tables, string tables, relocation information, and more.

The crucial fields indirectly related to this vulnerability would be within the **Section Header**, where the `sh_type` field indicates the section type (e.g., SHT_REL, SHT_RELA among others) and the section name is stored in the section header string table, pointed to by the `sh_name` field in each section header. Since the vulnerability stems from assumptions about section names that start with `.rel` or `.rela`, any handling or processing logic tied to these assumptions is implicated.

While not a direct "field" per se in terms of the ELF specification, the way that BFD (and by extension, utilities like `objcopy` and `strip`) interprets these sections based on their names and types led to the global buffer over-read error described. Thus, it's the handling of section names (which correlates with the `sh_name` in section headers) in conjunction with the section types (`sh_type`), in context for SHT_REL and SHT_RELA types, that relates to this CVE's invocation within the ELF processing workflow in vulnerable versions of the BFD library.
