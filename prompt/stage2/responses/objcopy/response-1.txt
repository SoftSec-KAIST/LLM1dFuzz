The field in the ELF format that is directly related to invoking CVE-2017-8393 is the section name, located in the section header table. Specifically, the vulnerability arises due to assumptions about the naming of SHT_REL and SHT_RELA sections, which involve relocation information in ELF binaries. These sections are expected to start with a `.rel` or `.rela` prefix according to the faulty logic in the affected versions of the BFD library distributed with GNU Binutils 2.28. 

ELF binaries containing SHT_REL or SHT_RELA sections that do not adhere to this naming convention can trigger the vulnerability, as the code incorrectly assumes the presence of these prefixes when attempting to process relocation sections. This leads to a global buffer over-read, as the program may read beyond the bounds of the intended data.

The section header table in an ELF binary describes all sections present in the ELF file. Each entry in this table includes fields like the section name (pointing to a string in the section header string table), the section type (e.g., SHT_REL for relocation entries without explicit addends, SHT_RELA for relocation entries with explicit addends), and other attributes related to the section. It's the section name field in combination with the assumptions made about it (expecting `.rel`/`.rela` prefixes for relocation sections) that is at the heart of CVE-2017-8393.
