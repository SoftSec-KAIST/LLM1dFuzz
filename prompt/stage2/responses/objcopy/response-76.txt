The field in ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) relevant to CVE-2017-8393 is directly associated with the handling of relocation sections, specifically the `sh_type` field in section headers. This field identifies the type of each section within an ELF file. For the context of this vulnerability, the affected `sh_type` values are SHT_REL and SHT_RELA, which represent relocation entries without explicit addends and relocation entries with explicit addends, respectively.

Relocation sections are crucial for dynamic linking and loading, as they contain entries that describe how to adjust symbol addresses or perform other fix-ups at runtime or link time. The flaw arises from the assumption in the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library's handling of these sectionsâ€”specifically, that their names (`sh_name`, referencing the section name string table) always start with `.rel` or `.rela`. The mishandling of sections based on this assumption, without verifying the actual `sh_type`, leads to the buffer over-read vulnerability described.

Hence, it's the combination of `sh_type` (specifying the section is of relocation type) and incorrect assumptions about `sh_name` (expecting specific naming patterns for such sections) that is at the heart of this CVE. The patch addresses this by altering the logic to correctly handle the mapping of relocation sections to their target sections based on actual section properties rather than presumed naming conventions.
