The field in ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) files that is related to invoking CVE-2017-8393 is the `sh_type` field of section headers, specifically when it indicates relocation sections (SHT_REL or SHT_RELA). This field is part of the section header in ELF files and defines the section's type, such as whether it contains relocation information.

In the context of CVE-2017-8393, the crucial operation involves handling sections of type `SHT_REL` or `SHT_RELA`, which contain relocation entries. These entries are meant to be applied to other sections as part of the linking process or when applying binary modifications (e.g., with objcopy or strip). The vulnerability stemmed from an incorrect assumption in the handling code that these sections would always be named with a `.rel` or `.rela` prefix, respectively. This assumption is leveraged through the logic that processes the `sh_type` field to identify relocation sections and then incorrectly infers the sections to which they apply based on their names. Thus, the `sh_type` field, coupled with the flawed logic around section naming conventions, plays a pivotal role in triggering the issue described by CVE-2017-8393.
