The CVE-2017-8393 vulnerability is closely related to the handling of ELF section headers, specifically those concerning relocation sections identified by types SHT_REL and SHT_RELA. In an ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) file, each section has a header that describes the section's size, offset, type, and other attributes. The types SHT_REL and SHT_RELA denote relocation sections, which contain entries needed to adjust symbol addresses based on their final addresses in memory.

The vulnerability arises from the handling of the section names in the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library. The section name is a field within the section header, pointed to by the `sh_name` field of the `Elf[32|64]_Shdr` structure, which indexes into the section header string table section. This name is used by applications that read or process ELF files to identify the purpose and content of each section.

The incorrect assumption that caused CVE-2017-8393 was that these relocation sections' names would always start with the prefixes `.rel` or `.rela`. This assumption is utilized when the BFD library, specifically in the tools `objcopy` and `strip` which are part of the GNU Binutils package, processes the ELF sections for various operations. The logic error leads to a global buffer over-read when the actual names of the sections do not meet this assumption, causing these tools to crash or behave unexpectedly.

The patch for CVE-2017-8393 addressed this issue by changing how the BFD library determines which section a given relocation section applies to, making the mechanism more flexible and no longer reliant on the section name prefix. This directly impacts the way section headers are interpreted and handled, ensuring the software correctly processes sections regardless of their naming conventions.
