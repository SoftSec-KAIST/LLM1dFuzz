The field in ELF related to invoking CVE-2017-8393 is associated with how relocation sections, specifically SHT_REL and SHT_RELA sections, are named and identified. In the ELF format, sections such as SHT_REL (for relinking information without explicit addends) and SHT_RELA (for relinking information with explicit addends) are used for holding relocation information. The vulnerability specifically arises from how these sections' names are handled by the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library.

In the context of the vulnerability, the flawed assumption was that these sections' names would always start with ".rel" for SHT_REL sections or ".rela" for SHT_RELA sections. This assumption is deeply intertwined with the handling of the `sh_type` field of the ELF Section Header, which indicates the section's content or semantics. The mechanism for determining the target section of the relocations (which relies on section names starting with these prefixes) made the software vulnerable to a buffer over-read error when it encountered sections not conforming to this naming convention.

The problem is not with the ELF format itself but with the BFD library's handling of these ELF sections. The fix involves changing the logic to correctly map the given name of a relocation section (after stripping the .rel/.rela prefix) to the actual target section, regardless of the naming convention, thereby addressing the erroneous assumption and preventing the crash.

To summarize, the ELF-related aspect that triggers this CVE is the handling of the section names for SHT_REL and SHT_RELA sections within the BFD library, influenced by the assumptions made around the `sh_type` field values and the corresponding section names.
