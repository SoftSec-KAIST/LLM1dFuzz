The CVE-2017-8393 vulnerability is specifically related to the handling of ELF section names and the assumption that certain section names (specifically, relocation sections) start with a `.rel` or `.rela` prefix. The fields in the ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) file format most relevant to this vulnerability are the section headers (`sh_type` and `sh_name`), which define the type and name of each section in the ELF file.

1. **`sh_type` field**: This field in the section header specifies the section's content and semantics. The vulnerability particularly involves sections of types `SHT_REL` and `SHT_RELA`, which correspond to relocation sections with explicit addends (`SHT_RELA`) and without explicit addends (`SHT_REL`), respectively.

2. **`sh_name` field**: This is an index into the section header string table section, giving the location of a null-terminated string which is the name of the section. The erroneous assumption made in the vulnerable code was that sections of types `SHT_REL` and `SHT_RELA` would always have names starting with `.rel` or `.rela`. However, this is not always the case, and relying on this assumption can lead to a buffer over-read when the code encounters a differently named section it erroneously attempts to interpret under these assumptions.

The root cause of the vulnerability lies in the code logic that incorrectly assumes the naming convention of the sections based on their `sh_type` (assuming that `SHT_REL`/`SHT_RELA` sections begin with `.rel`/`.rela`). When this naming convention is not met, the logic can lead to accessing memory beyond the buffer meant for section names, thus causing a buffer over-read error. The patch for this CVE addressed the issue by modifying how the relocation section is determined without solely relying on the section names starting with specific prefixes.
