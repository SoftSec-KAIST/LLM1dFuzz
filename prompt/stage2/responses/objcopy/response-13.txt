The field in ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) files related to invoking CVE-2017-8393 is primarily associated with section headers, specifically the handling of SHT_REL and SHT_RELA sections, which represent relocation information within ELF files. These sections contain entries that describe how to modify the program code or data to adjust for the absolute address locations determined at runtime or load time.

In the context of the vulnerability, the issue involves the assumptions made about the naming conventions of these relocation sections. Typically, relocation sections in ELF files follow the naming convention of starting with `.rel` or `.rela` (depending on whether they are using implicit addends or explicit addends, respectively). The problematic assumption here was that all SHT_REL and SHT_RELA sections would have names starting with these prefixes.

The critical part of the ELF responsible for this vulnerability is the mechanism that processes these section headers (SHT_REL and SHT_RELA) when tools like `objcopy` or `strip` (which rely on the libbfd library) attempt to analyze or modify ELF files. Incorrect handling based on the name assumptions could lead to a buffer over-read, triggering crashes or unintended behaviors when these tools are used. This vulnerability underscores the importance of correctly parsing and validating ELF file structures, including section names and types, to maintain the integrity and reliability of binary analysis and manipulation tools.
