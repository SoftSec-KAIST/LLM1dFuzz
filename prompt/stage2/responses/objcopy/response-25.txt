The field in ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) files that is primarily related to invoking CVE-2017-8393 is the section name field of SHT_REL/SHR_RELA sections. The vulnerability is triggered due to the assumptions made by the GNU Binutils' Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library concerning the naming conventions of these sections. Typically, relocation sections in ELF files start with a .rel or .rela prefix, followed by the name of the section to which the relocations apply (e.g., .rel.text for the .text section).

The BFD library expected these relocation sections to adhere strictly to this naming convention (.rel/.rela prefix) when identifying and processing them. However, if a section did not follow this naming pattern, it led to a global buffer over-read error because the library's logic attempted to access section information based on incorrect assumptions about the section name's format. This error occurs during the analysis and manipulation of binary files by tools that use the BFD library, such as objcopy and strip, potentially causing them to crash.

So, it is the manipulation and interpretation of the section name field within the ELF structure, specifically for SHT_REL (relocation entries without explicit addends) and SHT_RELA (relocation entries with explicit addends) sections, that is at the heart of this vulnerability. The patch for this CVE modifies how the BFD library interprets these names, allowing for correct processing of sections regardless of whether they follow the expected naming convention, thereby preventing the buffer over-read and associated crashes.
