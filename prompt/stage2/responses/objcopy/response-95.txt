The field in the ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) file related to invoking CVE-2017-8393 is the section name field of relocation sections (`SHT_REL` and `SHT_RELA`). Specifically, the vulnerability stems from an incorrect assumption in the BFD (Binary File Descriptor) library about how these section names should be prefixed. The assumption was that names of sections carrying relocation information always start with `.rel` for `SHT_REL` sections or `.rela` for `SHT_RELA` sections. This incorrect assumption could lead to a global buffer over-read issue when the libbfd library processes ELF files where the relocation section names do not adhere to this prefixed naming convention. 

The issue arises in code handling operations by tools like `objcopy` and `strip`, which make use of the BFD library to perform binary manipulations, including the processing of relocation sections. Since the section name field in the ELF header for these sections might not always follow the expected pattern, improperly handled assumptions about this naming convention can lead to vulnerabilities like CVE-2017-8393.
