The field in ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) files related to invoking CVE-2017-8393 is primarily the section name field for SHT_REL and SHT_RELA sections. The vulnerability was due to assumptions made regarding the naming of these sections, specifically expecting them to always begin with a `.rel` or `.rela` prefix.

In ELF files, each section has a header which includes fields like the section name, type (e.g., SHT_REL for relocation entries without explicit addends, SHT_RELA for relocation entries with explicit addends), and other attributes. The section name itself is stored as an index into a section header string table section (`.shstrtab`), rather than directly in the section header. The issue was not with the ELF format specification itself but with the GNU Binutils BFD library's handling of these sections based on their names.

The root cause of CVE-2017-8393 stems from the handling code in the BFD library making incorrect assumptions about the naming convention of relocation sections, leading it to perform buffer over-read operations when the actual section names did not conform to the expected `.rel`/`.rela` prefix pattern. This mismanagement pertained to decoding and processing the section headers (`sh_type` field for identifying the section type as SHT_REL or SHT_RELA) and the section name index pointing to the string in the `.shstrtab` section.
