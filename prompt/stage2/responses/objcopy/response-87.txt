The field in ELF related to invoking CVE-2017-8393 is primarily the section header, specifically the `sh_type` field that denotes the section's type, such as SHT_REL or SHT_RELA. These types indicate that the section contains relocation information. The vulnerability was triggered due to assumptions made about the naming of such sections (typically expected to start with .rel or .rela) when the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library processes ELF files, particularly in the context of operations performed by tools like objcopy and strip.

When BFD library functions attempted to process these relocation sections based on the naming convention (by skipping directly to the suffix after ".rel" or ".rela"), without validating that the sections indeed followed this naming pattern, it led to a global buffer over-read. This error occurs because the code did not account for the possibility of relocation sections not following the presumed naming convention and attempted to access data beyond the bounds defined by the actual section names in the ELF file.

Thus, while the direct trigger relates to how libbfd interprets section names (an aspect not explicitly defined in a single ELF field), the `sh_type` field indicating a section contains relocation information is central to the scenario under which CVE-2017-8393 could be exploited. The improper handling of sections based on their names rather than solely their types and the content they hold led to the vulnerability.
