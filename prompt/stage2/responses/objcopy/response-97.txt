The field in ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) related to invoking CVE-2017-8393 is the section name field for SHT_REL and SHT_RELA sections. The vulnerability is specifically related to the handling of these section names in the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library. The issue arises when the BFD library assumes that the names of all relocation sections (SHT_REL for relocation entries without explicit addends and SHT_RELA for relocation entries with explicit addends) start with the prefixes ".rel" for SHT_REL sections or ".rela" for SHT_RELA sections.

Relocation sections in ELF files contain entries that describe how to modify the program code and data to make it run at a different address than it was compiled for. The `sh_type` field in the section header would be set to SHT_REL or SHT_RELA to indicate the type of relocation entries contained within the section. The vulnerability was triggered by incorrectly handling the `sh_name` field, which contains the name of the section, due to the assumption about these prefixes.

This incorrect assumption could lead to a buffer over-read error because the code attempted to access data beyond the actual name string, based on the expected prefix length, when trying to identify the target section for the relocations. This vulnerability could cause crashes in tools like `objcopy` and `strip` that use the libbfd library to process ELF files with relocation sections not adhering to the naming assumption.
