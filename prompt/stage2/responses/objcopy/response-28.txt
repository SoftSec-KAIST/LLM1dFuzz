The field in the ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) files that is related to invoking CVE-2017-8393 is primarily concerned with the section headers, specifically the `sh_type` field of the ELF Section Header. The vulnerability involves sections of type `SHT_REL` and `SHT_RELA`, which correspond to relocation entries without and with addends, respectively. The issue arises when handling these types of sections under the assumption that their names must start with `.rel` or `.rela` prefixes, which is not a requirement according to the ELF specification.

In detail:
- **`sh_type` field**: This field in the section header indicates the section's content and semantics. For CVE-2017-8393, the affected `sh_type` values are `SHT_REL` and `SHT_RELA`, which denote sections containing "relocation" entries. These entries are used to adjust symbol references once the actual memory addresses are known.

The vulnerability is not in the ELF specification itself but in the GNU Binutils implementation, specifically within the libbfd library's handling of sections identified by these `sh_type` values. The incorrect handling is due to the assumption made about section names beginning with `.rel` and `.rela`, leading to a global buffer over-read when sections do not follow this naming convention. This mismanagement can cause applications like `objcopy` and `strip`, which rely on libbfd for binary file manipulations, to crash when processing malformed or unconventional ELF files.
