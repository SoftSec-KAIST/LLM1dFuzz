The vulnerability CVE-2017-8393 is closely related to the handling of section header types and names in ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) files, specifically the SHT_REL and SHT_RELA section types. These types correspond to relocation information in the binary, where SHT_REL represents relocation entries without explicit addends, and SHT_RELA represents relocation entries with explicit addends.

The ELF format includes a section header for each section in a file. The section header contains information necessary for program execution or processing of the file, such as section names, sizes, and types. The problem described in the CVE arises from how the BFD library interprets the names of sections corresponding to the SHT_REL and SHT_RELA types.

In ELF, the section names are stored in a string table, and each section header has a `sh_name` field that contains the index into the string table for its name. The assumption that led to this vulnerability was that sections of types SHT_REL and SHT_RELA always had names starting with ".rel" or ".rela", respectively. This is denoted in the section names which are referenced through the `sh_name` field of the section headers.

When utilities such as `objcopy` and `strip` processed ELF files, they depended on this naming convention assumption to identify relocation sections and perform actions on them. Because of the faulty assumption that all relevant sections would follow this naming convention, when encountering an ELF file where this was not the case, it could result in a buffer over-read, where the utility accessed memory beyond the intended buffer, leading to crashes or unintended behavior.

Thus, the key field in the ELF structure related to triggering CVE-2017-8393 is the `sh_name` field in the section headers, which is used to store the index into the string table where the name of the section is located. The vulnerability was essentially about the handling and assumptions made about the values found via this `sh_name` index, particularly for section names associated with relocation information (SHT_REL and SHT_RELA types).
