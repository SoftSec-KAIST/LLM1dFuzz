The field in ELF format that relates to invoking CVE-2017-8393 is associated with the naming and interpretation of the section headers, particularly those representing relocation information, which are identified by their types `SHT_REL` and `SHT_RELA`.

In the ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) specification, each section within the file has a header that describes its characteristics, including its name (stored as an index into the section header string table), type, and other attributes. The types `SHT_REL` and `SHT_RELA` are used for sections containing "relocation" entries, which provide information necessary to update the program's symbolic references and adjust them for their actual memory addresses when the program is loaded into memory.

The vulnerability arises from the incorrect handling of the section name associated with `SHT_REL` and `SHT_RELA` sections by the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library. The library made an assumption that these sections always have names starting with `.rel` and `.rela`, respectively. This assumption is leveraged in parts of the code responsible for handling relocation information, such as in `objcopy` and `strip` tools, which use libbfd.

When these tools encounter a section whose name does not conform to the expected naming convention (`SHT_REL`/`SHR_RELA` sections not starting with `.rel`/.rela`), they can experience a buffer over-read scenario because the code mistakenly assumes the section name's format and tries to access memory beyond the actual data, leading to crashes and potential security implications.

The specific handling of section names and the expectation around `.rel`/`.rela` prefixes are the key elements related to this CVE within the ELF's structure and processing logic in the affected tools. The patch corrects this by adapting the function responsible for linking relocation sections with their target sections without relying on a fixed naming scheme, thus addressing the root cause tied to ELF section handling.
