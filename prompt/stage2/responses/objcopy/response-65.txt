The field in ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) files related to invoking CVE-2017-8393 is the section name field for SHT_REL/SHR_RELA sections. The vulnerability occurred due to the incorrect handling of these section names, specifically the assumption that they always start with a ".rel" or ".rela" prefix. This field is part of the ELF section header and is crucial for identifying the purpose and content of each section in an ELF file.

The vulnerability was specifically related to how GNU Binutils' libbfd library interpreted these names, leading to a buffer over-read when these assumptions did not hold. Instead of relying solely on the section names starting with these prefixes to identify SHT_REL/SHR_RELA sections, the patch involves changing the logic to more accurately determine the target sections for relocation entries, without making assumptions based on naming conventions.
