The field in the ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) file format that is directly related to invoking CVE-2017-8393 is the section name field for SHT_REL/SHT_RELA sections. Specifically, the assumption that these relocation sections (SHT_REL for rel entries and SHT_RELA for rela entries, which contain "addend" information in addition to the standard rel field) always start with the `.rel` or `.rela` prefix in their section names was at the heart of the issue.

In ELF files, each section has a name that is stored in a dedicated string table section, commonly `.shstrtab` for section names. The section header for each section contains, among other things, a `sh_name` field, which is an index into the `.shstrtab` section where the actual name of the section is stored.

The vulnerability was triggered because of the way libbfd processed these section names for SHT_REL and SHT_RELA sections. The BFD library expected that the names of these sections would always be prefixed with `.rel` or `.rela`, failing to correctly process section names that did not adhere to this naming convention. This incorrect assumption led to a buffer over-read vulnerability, as the code would incorrectly interpret or navigate the buffer based on the expected prefixes, potentially accessing memory outside the intended bounds.

The patch addressed this issue by changing the logic for how libbfd identifies the target sections to which relocation entries apply, making it more robust against variations in naming conventions and thus directly addressing the root cause linked to the handling of the `sh_name` field for SHT_REL and SHT_RELA sections in ELF files.
