The field in ELF files that is related to invoking CVE-2017-8393 is the section name field associated with SHT_REL and SHT_RELA sections. The vulnerability stems from the incorrect assumption that these relocation sections' names always start with a ".rel" or ".rela" prefix. When the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library, specifically in utilities like `objcopy` and `strip`, processes ELF files, it incorrectly assumes these prefixes are present and uses them to identify sections to which relocations apply.

This issue is directly tied to the handling of section names in ELF files. Each section in an ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) file has a header, which includes fields like the section name (held in a separate string table), the section type (e.g., SHT_REL for relocation entries without explicit addends, SHT_RELA for relocation entries with explicit addends), and other attributes. The CVE manifests when the logic for processing these sections wrongly presumes the naming convention, thereby leading to a global buffer over-read when encountering ELF files where these assumptions do not hold.

The patch for this CVE changes how the names of relocation sections are processed. It involves modifying functions to confirm the section to which relocations apply without relying solely on prefixed names. This approach mitigates the risk associated with making assumptions about section naming in ELF files, addressing the vulnerability's root cause. The affected code paths specifically deal with how these section names are interpreted and matched to their corresponding sections in the ELF file, indicating that the section name field in the context of SHT_REL and SHT_RELA sections is directly related to the exploitation of this CVE.
