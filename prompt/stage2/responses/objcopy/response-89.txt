The CVE-2017-8393 relates to how sections of type SHT_REL and SHT_RELA in ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) files are handled by the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library in GNU Binutils 2.28. Specifically, the vulnerability stems from the incorrect assumption that these relocation sections always start with a ".rel" or ".rela" prefix in their names. The handling of these sections is crucial for the functionality of tools like `objcopy` and `strip`, which rely on accurately interpreting the ELF section headers to modify and analyze binary files.

In ELF files, each section header (described in the ELF specification) includes a field that identifies the type of the section. The `sh_type` field of an ELF section header determines whether a section contains relocation information (`SHT_REL` for relocation entries without explicit addends, or `SHT_RELA` for relocation entries with explicit addends). The issue described in CVE-2017-8393 involves these specific `sh_type` values, as the vulnerability occurs during the processing of sections with these types based on the flawed naming assumption.

To resolve this vulnerability, patches were made to the BFD library to adjust how relocation sections are identified and handled, allowing for accurate processing of `SHT_REL` and `SHT_RELA` sections regardless of their naming conventions. This change ensures that programs such as `objcopy` and `strip` can correctly interpret and manipulate ELF files without crashing due to the buffer over-read problem initially caused by this incorrect assumption.
