The field in the ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) that is related to invoking CVE-2017-8393 is specifically the section names of relocation information, represented by section types `SHT_REL` and `SHT_RELA`. The vulnerability arose from incorrect assumptions about these section names always starting with a `.rel/.rela` prefix.

In ELF files, relocation entries are stored in sections of types `SHT_REL` and `SHT_RELA`, which are meant to inform the linker or loader how to adjust symbol addresses so that the executable or shared library can correctly resolve addresses at runtime or load time. Each entry within these sections describes how to modify a particular location within the executable section, typically to resolve symbol references.

The bug in the GNU Binutils libbfd library originated from code that incorrectly assumed all such sections would be named with a prefix suggesting their type â€“ `.rel` for `SHT_REL` sections and `.rela` for `SHT_RELA` sections. This incorrect assumption led to a global buffer over-read error when encountering a section with relocation information that did not follow this naming convention, as the code would misinterpret the section's contents or metadata, causing tools like `objcopy` and `strip` to crash.

Therefore, it is the section name handling (or misinterpretation thereof) for `SHT_REL` and `SHT_RELA` types within ELF files that directly relates to the invocation of CVE-2017-8393. The patch addressed this by altering how the libbfd library identifies and processes the sections associated with relocation entries, removing the reliance on the section name prefixes and instead dynamically identifying applicable sections based on actual names and contexts.
