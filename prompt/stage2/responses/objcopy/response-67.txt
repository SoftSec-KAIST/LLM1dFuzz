The field in ELF related to invoking CVE-2017-8393 is primarily the section name field within the ELF section header. The vulnerability is triggered by the handling of relocation sections (specifically, `SHT_REL` and `SHT_RELA` sections) whose names do not start with the conventionally expected `.rel` or `.rela` prefix. The Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library, as used in GNU Binutils, incorrectly assumed that the names of all such sections would follow this naming pattern. This assumption was utilized when the library attempted to match relocation sections with their corresponding target sections for relocation processing.

ELF files contain a series of headers, including section headers that describe each section within the file. The section header includes, among other things, an offset into the section name string table (`sh_name`), which is used to identify the section by name. It is this part of the section header (the `sh_name`, indirectly, through its reference in the string table) combined with the logic in Binutils (specifically, in the affected versions up to 2.28 before the patch) that leads to the vulnerability. When `objcopy`, `strip`, or another tool using libbfd processes an ELF file with a relocation section not adhering to the naming expectations, it could attempt to access memory out of bounds, leading to a crash due to the global buffer over-read error.

The patch for this vulnerability corrected the issue by changing how the library identifies the section to which relocations apply, removing the unsafe assumption about section names and instead dynamically identifying the relevant section based on actual string comparisons and handling within the ELF processing code.
