The field in ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) related to invoking CVE-2017-8393 is the section name field for SHT_REL and SHT_RELA sections. Specifically, the vulnerability is triggered by the handling of these section names in the libbfd library, which is part of GNU Binutils. The CVE is caused by the incorrect assumption that these section names always start with `.rel` or `.rela`. This assumption affects how these sections are identified and processed. If a section containing relocation information does not follow this naming convention, it could lead to a buffer over-read error when utilities like `objcopy` and `strip` attempt to process it.

The section name field in the ELF section header is intended to hold the name of the section. The ELF format specifies that each section has a header, which includes fields like the section name, type (e.g., SHT_REL for relocation entries without explicit addends or SHT_RELA for relocation entries with explicit addends), and other attributes. These headers are indexed in the section header table. The section name itself is stored in a string table, and the section name field in the section header is an index into this string table.

The vulnerability (CVE-2017-8393) relates specifically to how these section names are interpreted and processed by the libbfd library when performing operations like object copying or stripping, under the assumption that certain naming conventions are followed. This mishandling could cause the affected utilities to read beyond the allocated buffer when a section name does not adhere to the expected `.rel` or `.rela` prefix, leading to potential crashes and constituting a denial-of-service vulnerability.
