The CVE-2017-8393 vulnerability is related to the handling of ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) sections specifically designated for relocation information, namely the SHT_REL and SHT_RELA section types. These sections are crucial for the dynamic linking process as they contain relocation information needed to adjust the symbolic references or memory addresses in a program during its loading or execution.

The root cause of the vulnerability is the incorrect assumption in the GNU Binutils Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library that these sections always begin with a `.rel` or `.rela` prefix in their names. This flawed assumption affects how the library, and consequently utilities like `objcopy` and `strip` that depend on it, process these relocation sections (SHT_REL for relocation entries without explicit addends and SHT_RELA for relocation entries with explicit addends).

In the context of ELF structure, the SHT_REL and SHT_RELA sections correspond to `sh_type` fields within section headers (`Shdr`), where `sh_type` indicates the section content and semantics. The BFD library tries to identify the target section which the relocation applies to based on the relocation section's name prefix, leading to a global buffer over-read error when the section names do not conform to the expected naming pattern.

To rectify this, the patch modifies how the target sections for SHT_REL/SHT_RELA types are determined, by changing the logic from relying merely on name prefixes to a more robust method that accommodates various naming conventions, thereby preventing the buffer over-read scenario that led to the vulnerability.
