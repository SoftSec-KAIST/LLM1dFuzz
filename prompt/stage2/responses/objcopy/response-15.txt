The field in ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) files that is related to invoking CVE-2017-8393 is the section name field within the section header table. The vulnerability specifically involves the handling of SHT_REL and SHT_RELA section types, which contain relocation information. These types of sections are used during the linking process to adjust symbol pointers. The assumption that was made, and which led to this vulnerability, is that these sections' names always start with a ".rel" or ".rela" prefix. 

ELF files are structured with a header that describes how to interpret the file, followed by several tables and data sections. One such table is the section header table, which describes all the sections within an ELF file, including their names, sizes, and types. Each entry in this table refers to a section in the ELF file, and one of the fields in this entry is the section name. This name is a string that typically follows certain conventions for naming, but these conventions are not enforced by the ELF specification itself.

The problem that leads to CVE-2017-8393 arises when `objcopy` and `strip` tools, which use the libbfd library to operate on binary files, proceed under the assumption that the relocation sections are named with the mentioned prefixes. When they encounter a relocation section that doesn't follow this naming convention, these tools experience a buffer over-read, as they try to access parts of the section header name string that do not exist, leading to crashes.

Therefore, it's not a specific field within the ELF file that is directly responsible for the vulnerability, but rather the handling of the section name field (stored in the section header table and pointed to by the `sh_name` field in each section header) for sections of types SHT_REL and SHT_RELA by the affected utilities due to the incorrect assumptions in the libbfd code.
