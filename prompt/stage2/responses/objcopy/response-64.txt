The field in ELF that is related to invoking CVE-2017-8393 is essentially the name field of relocation sections, specifically those of types `SHT_REL` and `SHT_RELA`. The vulnerability stems from the assumption within the GNU Binutils `libbfd` library that these sectionsâ€™ names always start with the prefixes `.rel` and `.rela`.

In ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) files, sections are used to store different types of information, and each section has a header describing its characteristics. Among these characteristics, the `sh_type` field of a section header indicates the section's type, such as `SHT_REL` for relocation entries without explicit addends, or `SHT_RELA` for relocation entries with explicit addends. Each of these sections is expected to hold relocation information needed during the linking process or by the loader.

The problematic assumption was that sections of these types would have names prefixed accordingly, which was not always the case. As a result, when `libbfd`-based tools like `objcopy` and `strip` encountered relocation sections without these expected name prefixes, it led to a global buffer over-read error. This error occurred because the code would attempt to process the section's name in a way that presumed the presence of these prefixes, leading to potential memory access beyond the allocated buffer when those expectations were not met.

Therefore, while the `sh_type` field indirectly relates to this CVE by indicating the section's intended role and processing pathway, it is the section's name field and the handling of it within `libbfd` that directly contributes to the vulnerability observed. The patch corrected this issue by removing the hard-coded assumption about the naming convention and implementing a safer, more flexible way of handling relocation section names.
