The field in ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) related to invoking CVE-2017-8393 is the section name field of relocation sections, specifically for sections of type SHT_REL and SHT_RELA. The vulnerability arises from the handling of these section names in the context of the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library used in GNU Binutils.

Relocation sections in ELF files contain entries that describe how to modify other sections in the binary at runtime or load time, based on symbol values. The types of these sections, SHT_REL and SHT_RELA, specify different formats for these entries. The issue with CVE-2017-8393 is linked to the assumption that the names of these relocation sections start with ".rel" or ".rela", which indicates their role in relocation but does not account for cases where a section's name does not follow this convention.

This flawed assumption about section names can lead to a global buffer over-read error because the code that processes these sections (for operations like `objcopy` and `strip`, which analyze or modify ELF files) incorrectly anticipates the naming pattern and thus may access memory beyond the intended buffer when attempting to locate and process the target section for relocations. This vulnerability is specifically triggered by how these section names are interpreted and handled during the processing of ELF files by tools that use the libbfd library.
