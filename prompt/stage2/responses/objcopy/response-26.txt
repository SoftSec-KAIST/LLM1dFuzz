The field in ELF related to invoking CVE-2017-8393 is the section name field, particularly for the `SHT_REL` and `SHT_RELA` section types. These sections contain relocation information, and the vulnerability arises from the incorrect assumption that these sections' names always start with a `.rel` or `.rela` prefix. The handling mechanism in the BFD library, as described, fails when it encounters relocation sections with non-standard names that don't follow this naming convention, leading to a global buffer over-read error. This flaw specifically impacts the way `objcopy` and `strip` commands parse and process ELF files, relying on the libbfd library's functionality to interpret the section names for `SHT_REL`/`SHT_RELA` sections improperly.
