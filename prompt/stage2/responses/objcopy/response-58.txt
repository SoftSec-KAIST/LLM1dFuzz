The field in ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) related to invoking CVE-2017-8393 is primarily the section name field within the section headers. The vulnerability arises from the incorrect handling of relocation sections, specifically those with types SHT_REL and SHT_RELA. The issue stems from the assumption that these sections' names always start with the prefixes `.rel` or `.rela`. This assumption is used when the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library, as part of GNU Binutils, tries to identify to which section the relocations apply.

In ELF files, each section has an associated header described in the ELF specification. Among the fields in a section header is `sh_name`, which holds an index into the section header string table, pointing to the name of the section. The vulnerability is triggered when the handling code encounters relocation sections (`SHT_REL` or `SHT_RELA`) that do not conform to the expected naming convention, leading to a global buffer over-read error. This is because the library code, before the patch, blindly skips a certain number of characters, expecting the names to have `.rel/.rela` prefixes, to find the name of the target section for the relocations. When the actual name does not meet this expectation, it can cause crashes in applications using the libbfd library to process ELF files, such as `objcopy` and `strip`.

The patch corrects this issue by modifying how the target sections of relocations are determined, removing the reliance on the section name prefixes and instead dynamically identifying the correct section based on more reliable criteria. Thus, the handling of the `sh_name` field, indirectly, through safer and more accurate identification of section relationships in ELF files, is central to addressing the vulnerability.
