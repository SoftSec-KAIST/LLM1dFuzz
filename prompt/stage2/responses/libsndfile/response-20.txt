Based on the previous information and focusing on the description of the CVE and the provided patch, the root cause of CVE-2018-19758 is indeed the lack of a proper sanity check on the `psf->instrument->loop_count` variable in `libsndfile` before it is used. When libsndfile processes WAV files, this variable is related to the 'smpl' chunk of a WAV file.

The 'smpl' (sample) chunk in a WAV file contains sample data for a waveform, including information about loops or cues within the waveform. This chunk can specify loop points indicating parts of the sample that should repeat either during specific conditions or indefinitely. The `loop_count` is supposed to represent the number of these loop points defined in the 'smpl' chunk.

Without a proper sanity check on the `loop_count` variable, an unusually large or unexpected value can lead to a heap-based buffer over-read because the software might attempt to read data beyond the allocated buffer while trying to process loop information. This behavior can lead to a denial of service as the program may crash or behave unexpectedly due to trying to access memory outside the bounds of the allocated buffer.

The patch addresses this issue by limiting `loop_count` to a sensible range, effectively preventing the software from attempting to process an impractical number of loops based on corrupted or maliciously crafted input data in the 'smpl' chunk of a WAV file.
