Apologies for the confusion earlier. Let's revisit the details of CVE-2018-19758 with regard to the information given and pinpoint the specific field in the WAV format that is related to invoking this CVE, based on the clarified root cause being the missing sanity check for a large `psf->instrument->loop_count` variable.

Given the clarified root cause is due to the lack of a sanity check for the `psf->instrument->loop_count` before its usage, we can deduce that this vulnerability is directly related to the handling of the `smpl` chunk within WAV files. The `smpl` (sample) chunk in a WAV file can include sample loop information, among other things. This chunk would naturally include data on how many loops are defined for a given sample, which corresponds to the `loop_count`.

The information directly linking to the invocation of this CVE is the handling of the sample loops (`loop_count`) within the `smpl` chunk. When `libsndfile` reads or writes WAV file headers, and it encounters the `smpl` chunk, it uses the `loop_count` variable to determine how many loop descriptors to read or write. Without a proper check on the maximum allowed value for `loop_count`, the software could attempt to read or write beyond the allocated buffer size if presented with a specially crafted WAV file that specifies a very high loop count. This is indicative of the vulnerability's nature being tied to the specifics of WAV file structure, particularly the handling of the `smpl` chunk.

In summary, the field in a WAV file related to invoking CVE-2018-19758 is the `loop_count` value within the `smpl` chunk. The vulnerability arises due to the missing sanity check on overly large values for this `loop_count`, which could lead to heap-based buffer over-reads when the software processes these sample loops.
