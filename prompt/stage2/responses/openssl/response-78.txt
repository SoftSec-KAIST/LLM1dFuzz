The CVE-2017-3735 vulnerability is specifically related to parsing the IPAddressFamily extension in an X.509 certificate. In the context of ASN.1 (Abstract Syntax Notation One) encoded in DER (Distinguished Encoding Rules), which is used for X.509 certificates, the field of interest would be the `addressFamily` data within the IPAddressFamily extension.

The vulnerability stems from improperly handling the length of this `addressFamily` data. ASN.1 DER encoding specifies both the type of data and its length explicitly. The `addressFamily` is expected to consist of at least 2 bytes of data, indicating the address family (e.g., IPv4, IPv6) being described. However, before the CVE-2017-3735 patch, the OpenSSL code did not adequately validate that this `addressFamily` data contained the necessary length of data before attempting to read from it.

Thus, the DER field(s) associated with this vulnerability would be the bytes representing the `addressFamily` data within an IPAddressFamily extension in the DER-encoded X.509 certificate. Specifically, it would involve the length and content of the `addressFamily->data` component as part of the ASN.1 encoding, which was used without proper bounds checking before the patch.
