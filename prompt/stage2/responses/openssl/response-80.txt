The vulnerability CVE-2017-3735 is related to the parsing of the `IPAddressFamily` extension in an X.509 certificate. In the context of DER (Distinguished Encoding Rules) encoding, which is used for encoding the X.509 certificates, this issue would be tied to how the `IPAddressFamily` extension's `addressFamily` field is encoded and interpreted.

In DER encoding, each data field is structured with a type, length, and value. The problem described in CVE-2017-3735 involves an improper handling of the length when parsing the `addressFamily` data. The `addressFamily` field itself would be part of the encoded data for the `IPAddressFamily` extension within an X.509 certificate, likely encoded as an OCTET STRING or a similarly suitable DER type. The vulnerability arises from reading this OCTET STRING without verifying that the length of the data is sufficient, leading to a one-byte overread.

Thus, while the CVE does not directly specify a DER field, it is the handling of the `addressFamily`'s data within the `IPAddressFamily` extension (which would be encoded according to DER rules) that leads to the vulnerability. The addressing and subsequent patch involve ensuring the length of the `addressFamily` data (its length in DER encoding) is properly verified before accessing it to avoid out-of-bounds reads.
