The CVE-2017-3735 vulnerability is specifically related to the handling of the `addressFamily` field within an IPAddressFamily extension in an X.509 certificate. The issue arises when parsing this part of the certificate, which is represented in Distinguished Encoding Rules (DER) format.

The field in question, `addressFamily`, is part of the IPAddressFamily structure which is expected to be at least 2 bytes long, according to the code. However, due to the lack of proper length validation before the patch, an attacker could craft a malicious X.509 certificate with an `addressFamily` field of less than 2 bytes, leading to a one-byte overread when OpenSSL attempts to construct the address family identifier from this field. This vulnerability arises during the parsing process, where DER encoded data is interpreted, and specifically impacts the way OpenSSL deals with the length of the `addressFamily->data` buffer. 

In the DER encoding, the length of each element should be explicitly defined, but the vulnerability showcases a failure to properly verify this length before accessing the data, assuming the presence of data does not guarantee its sufficiency in length for operations performed on it.
