The field in DER (Distinguished Encoding Rules) related to invoking CVE-2017-3735 is the `addressFamily` field in an IPAddressFamily extension of an X.509 certificate. The vulnerability occurs when parsing this specific extension, which is meant to represent the address family for the IP addresses contained in the certificate. The one-byte overread vulnerability arises due to improper validation of the length of the `addressFamily` data before it is accessed: the code originally did not verify that the `addressFamily` field contains at least two bytes before attempting to read these bytes to construct the Address Family Identifier (AFI). 

In essence, the CVE is invoked when handling a specifically crafted X.509 certificate that includes an IPAddressFamily extension with an `addressFamily` field that is malformed or not as expected (i.e., it is less than two bytes long), leading to potential misinterpretations of the subsequent byte(s) in memory as part of the `addressFamily` data. The DER encoding of the certificate improperly parsed could lead to the exploitation of this vulnerability.
