The CVE-2017-3735 vulnerability is related to the parsing of the `IPAddressFamily` extension in an X.509 certificate. Specifically, this issue is invoked when handling the `addressFamily` field within the `IPAddressFamily` structure. In DER (Distinguished Encoding Rules), which is used for the encoding of X.509 certificates, this field represents the address family (for example, IPv4 or IPv6) and it's part of the encoding that OpenSSL would parse.

When OpenSSL processes an X.509 certificate that contains the IPAddressFamily extension (part of the Subject Alternative Name or similar extensions that deal with IP addresses), it attempts to read the address family information contained within this field. The vulnerability occurred because OpenSSL did not properly verify that the `addressFamily` data is at least 2 bytes long before accessing its first two bytes. This could lead to a one-byte overread if the data provided is malformed or shorter than expected, which could potentially lead to an incorrect display of certificate information or other unintended behavior.

DER encoding requires each field to be properly length-specified, and the bug arose from mishandling situations where the data did not conform to expected length requirements. Thus, when OpenSSL encountered an `IPAddressFamily` with an `addressFamily` field that is malformed (for instance, being shorter than the necessary 2 bytes required for correct parsing), it led to this specific vulnerability being exposed.
