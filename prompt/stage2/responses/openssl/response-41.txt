The field in DER (Distinguished Encoding Rules) encoding that is related to invoking CVE-2017-3735 is the `IPAddressFamily` field in an X.509 certificate. Specifically, the vulnerability arises while parsing the `IPAddressFamily` extension of an X.509 certificate, which is part of the ASN.1 (Abstract Syntax Notation One) structure encoded using DER.

The `IPAddressFamily` field is intended to specify address family information associated with an IP address or a range of IP addresses. In the context of the vulnerability, the issue lies in how OpenSSL before versions 1.0.2m and 1.1.0g handles the parsing of this field. When the software tries to retrieve the Address Family Identifier (`AFI`) from the `IPAddressFamily` structure, it directly accesses the first two bytes of `addressFamily->data` without adequately checking whether the length (`addressFamily->length`) is sufficient to prevent an out-of-bounds read. This can lead to a situation where the parsing operation reads past the allocated buffer by one byte, which can cause undefined behavior including incorrect display of certificate text.

Thus, the field related to this CVE in the context of DER encoded data in an X.509 certificate is the `addressFamily` field within the `IPAddressFamily` extension.
