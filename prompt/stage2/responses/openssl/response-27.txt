The field in Distinguished Encoding Rules (DER) related to invoking CVE-2017-3735 is the `addressFamily` field within the IPAddressFamily extension in an X.509 certificate. Specifically, the vulnerability arises when parsing the `addressFamily` data, which is expected to be at least 2 bytes long to successfully construct an address family identifier. However, insufficient validation of the length of this data field before attempting to read from it can lead to a one-byte overread if the `addressFamily->length` is less than 2. 

DER is a binary encoding for data structures described by ASN.1 (Abstract Syntax Notation One). An X.509 certificate, which outlines the format of public key certificates, utilizes ASN.1 and is encoded using DER. The `addressFamily` field in the context of an X.509 certificate is part of the ASN.1 specification for representing an IP address family (e.g., IPv4, IPv6) in certain extensions like the IPAddressFamily extension. This field's inadequate validation and subsequent mishandling in OpenSSL before the versions 1.0.2m and 1.1.0g causes CVE-2017-3735.
