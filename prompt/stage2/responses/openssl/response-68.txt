The CVE-2017-3735 vulnerability is related to the processing of an IPAddressFamily extension in an X.509 certificate. In the context of DER (Distinguished Encoding Rules), which is a binary encoding format for data structures described by ASN.1 (Abstract Syntax Notation One), the specific field related to this vulnerability is the `addressFamily` field within the IPAddressFamily extension.

The IPAddressFamily extension is part of the X.509 Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) used to specify the address family (e.g., IPv4, IPv6) that the certificate is associated with. The vulnerability arises when OpenSSL, before versions 1.0.2m and 1.1.0g, parses an X.509 certificate containing an IPAddressFamily extension and does not correctly validate the length of the `addressFamily` data before accessing it. This can lead to a one-byte overread due to insufficient length checks.

In DER encoding, each field in the data structure is typically encoded with a type identifier, a length descriptor, and the actual data. In this case, the `addressFamily` field's data is expected to be accessed. For the vulnerability to be triggered, it would involve the DER-encoded data of an X.509 certificate where the length descriptor associated with the `addressFamily` data does not accurately reflect the data's length, thereby leading to improper handling and a possible one-byte overread when the software does not perform adequate length validation. The patch fixes this issue by adding a proper length check before attempting to access the `addressFamily` field's data, ensuring that there is enough length to safely read the expected data.
