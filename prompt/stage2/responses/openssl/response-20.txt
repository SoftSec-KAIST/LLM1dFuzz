Based on the information provided about CVE-2017-3735, the issue involves parsing an IPAddressFamily extension in an X.509 certificate. The specific field within the DER (Distinguished Encoding Rules) encoded data of an X.509 certificate that is related to invoking this CVE is the `addressFamily` field in the IPAddressFamily extension.

The `addressFamily` field is expected to contain data indicative of the address family (e.g., IPv4, IPv6) being represented. However, because of insufficient validation of the length of this field before accessing its data, an attacker could craft a certificate wherein the length of the `addressFamily` data is less than 2 bytes, thereby leading to a one-byte overread when the software attempts to read two bytes from this under-sized field as indicated in the code snippet provided in the previous explanation.

To elaborate, DER encoding specifies how types like integers, sequences, and octet strings are encoded into a binary format. Each field, including those within an X.509 certificate, is encoded with a type identifier, a length descriptor, and then the actual data. For CVE-2017-3735, the critical aspect of DER encoding relevant to the vulnerability involves the length descriptor of the `addressFamily` field's data within the IPAddressFamily extension. The vulnerability occurs because the original code did not adequately verify that the length descriptor indicated there was enough data (specifically, at least 2 bytes) to safely perform the operations that follow, leading to potential security issues when processing specially-crafted certificates.
