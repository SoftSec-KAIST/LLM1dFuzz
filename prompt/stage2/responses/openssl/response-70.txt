The field in DER (Distinguished Encoding Rules) encoding that is related to invoking CVE-2017-3735 is the `IPAddressFamily` extension in an X.509 certificate. Specifically, the vulnerability involves how the `addressFamily` field within the `IPAddressFamily` extension is parsed.

DER encoding is a method for encoding ASN.1 (Abstract Syntax Notation One) data structures, and it's extensively used in cryptographic protocols, including the encoding of X.509 certificates. X.509 certificates are structured data that use ASN.1, and their encoding with DER ensures a precise, unambiguous interpretation necessary for security-related applications.

The `IPAddressFamily` extension is part of the support for IP address blocks and AS (Autonomous System) identifiers in X.509 certificates. These are used, for example, in BGPsec (Border Gateway Protocol Security) to certify which IP address blocks or AS numbers are authorized for use by a particular entity. The `addressFamily` part specifies the type of IP addresses (such as IPv4 or IPv6) that the certificate is associated with.

In the case of CVE-2017-3735, the vulnerability arises from incorrectly assuming the existence and the minimum length of the `addressFamily->data` before verifying that assumption, leading to a one-byte overread if the `addressFamily->length` is less than 2. This overread happens during the parsing of an X.509 certificate's DER-encoded structure, specifically while interpreting the ASN.1 encoded `IPAddressFamily` extension field. The flaw can result in incorrect processing or display of the X.509 certificate content, although the practical impact might be limited to this incorrect display as per the known information about the vulnerability.
