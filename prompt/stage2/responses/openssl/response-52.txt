The field in Distinguished Encoding Rules (DER)-encoded data that is directly related to invoking CVE-2017-3735 is the `addressFamily` field in the IPAddressFamily extension of an X.509 certificate. This CVE is triggered during the parsing of this specific extension when OpenSSL does not sufficiently validate the length of the `addressFamily` data before accessing it, thereby potentially causing a one-byte overread. The `addressFamily` field is supposed to represent the address family (e.g., IPv4, IPv6) in networking related to the certificate subject. The flaw specifically arises due to the mishandling of the length check before reading the two bytes that represent the address family identifier in the DER-encoded data of the certificate.
