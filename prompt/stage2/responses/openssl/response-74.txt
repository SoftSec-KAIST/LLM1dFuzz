Based on the previous information regarding CVE-2017-3735, the vulnerability is related to how OpenSSL parses the IPAddressFamily extension in an X.509 certificate. Specifically, the issue rests within the handling of the `addressFamily` field when parsing an X.509 certificate in DER format. The `addressFamily` field is a part of the IPAddressFamily extension and is expected to contain at least two bytes that represent the address family identifier (AFI) when the DER-encoded certificate is parsed.

DER (Distinguished Encoding Rules) is a binary encoding for data structures described by ASN.1 (Abstract Syntax Notation One). Each field in a DER-encoded certificate is meticulously defined, including its length. In the case of CVE-2017-3735, the problem arises when the length of the `addressFamily` field's data is less than the expected 2 bytes. The flawed assumption in the vulnerable OpenSSL code did not account for a scenario where the DER-encoded `addressFamily` field might specify a length of less than 2, leading to a one-byte overread scenario.

Thus, the specific field in DER format, related to invoking CVE-2017-3735, is the `addressFamily` data within the IPAddressFamily extension. Proper validation of this field's length in the context of DER-encoded X.509 certificate parsing is essential for preventing this vulnerability.
