Given the information about CVE-2017-3735, the field in a DER-encoded (Distinguished Encoding Rules) X.509 certificate that is directly related to invoking this CVE is the `addressFamily` field within the IPAddressFamily extension. The IPAddressFamily extension is used to indicate the address family (e.g., IPv4, IPv6) that the certificate is associated with, and it is part of the X.509 certificate extensions which provide additional information and capabilities beyond the standard certificate fields.

The vulnerability specifically arises while parsing the `addressFamily` field, which is expected to contain at least two bytes of data: these two bytes represent the address family identifier. The original code did not check whether the `addressFamily->length` was at least two bytes before trying to access its data, leading to a possible one-byte overread if the data was shorter than expected. This problem occurs in the context of parsing DER-encoded data of an X.509 certificate, where the structure and length of data fields are critical for correct interpretation and security.

DER is a binary encoding for data structures described by ASN.1 (Abstract Syntax Notation One). In the context of X.509 certificates, ASN.1 defines the structure, and DER specifies exactly how each element is encoded into bytes. The field structure and length are key components in DER encoding, making it essential to handle them carefully to avoid vulnerabilities like CVE-2017-3735.
