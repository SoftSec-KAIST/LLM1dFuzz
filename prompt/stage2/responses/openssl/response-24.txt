Based on the information from the previous discussion about CVE-2017-3735, the specific field in Distinguished Encoding Rules (DER), which is a subset of ASN.1 used for encoding X.509 certificates, related to invoking this CVE is the `IPAddressFamily` field within an X.509 certificate.

When an X.509 certificate includes an `IPAddressFamily` extension, this field contains information about the address family (e.g., IPv4, IPv6). The vulnerability stems from how OpenSSL handles the parsing and length verification of the `addressFamily` data within the `IPAddressFamily` extension.

The crucial aspect relating to DER is the encoding and length of the `addressFamily` data. The flaw was triggered if the certificate contained an `IPAddressFamily` extension with `addressFamily` data that was shorter than expected (less than 2 bytes). Since DER-encoded data specifies the length of each element, this vulnerability specifically involves misinterpreting or mishandling the length of the `addressFamily` data as specified in the DER encoding of the X.509 certificate. The original code did not properly verify that the `addressFamily` was at least two bytes long, leading to a potential one-byte overread.

Therefore, while the root cause is tied to the handling of the `IPAddressFamily` extension within OpenSSL, it is indeed the DER-encoded `addressFamily` field of this extension in an X.509 certificate that is directly related to invoking CVE-2017-3735.
