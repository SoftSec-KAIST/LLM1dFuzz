CVE-2017-3735 is related to parsing the IPAddressFamily extension within an X.509 certificate. In the context of the vulnerability and the provided patch details, the field in DER (Distinguished Encoding Rules) format that can trigger this issue is specifically the `addressFamily` field within the IPAddressFamily extension.

In X.509 certificates, extensions allow for various functionalities and additional information to be included. The IPAddressFamily extension is used for representing address families (e.g., IPv4, IPv6) and related information in the certificate. The extension contains encoded data, which follows the DER format - a strict set of rules to encode and decode data structures used in cryptography and PKI environments.

The CVE is triggered when parsing the `addressFamily` field because the original code did not properly validate that this field contained at least two bytes of data before attempting to read from it. DER-encoded data for the `addressFamily` field should include its length, and the data itself, among other things, are parsed to extract the Address Family Identifier (AFI). The lack of validation for the length of the data field in the original implementation leads to the risk of an out-of-bounds read, hence invoking the CVE when a maliciously crafted certificate is processed.

Therefore, although the CVE is not related to a specific field of the DER encoding itself, but rather to how the OpenSSL code parsed the DER-encoded `addressFamily` field of an IPAddressFamily extension, ensuring correct handling of DER-encoded data during parsing operations is crucial for preventing such vulnerabilities.
