Based on the provided information regarding CVE-2017-3735, which is concerned with an issue in the parsing of the IPAddressFamily extension in an X.509 certificate, the vulnerable operation is directly related to how OpenSSL handles the extension's Address Family Identifier (AFI) part, which is encoded in Distinguished Encoding Rules (DER).

The DER format is a subset of the Basic Encoding Rules (BER), specifying a unique way to represent an ASN.1-encoded data structure. In the context of X.509 certificates, various fields and extensions are encoded in DER for secure and unambiguous transmission of information. The field related to invoking this CVE is part of the IPAddressFamily extension, which is used in certificates to specify IP address blocks or ranges that are associated with a certificate subject.

The vulnerability specifically revolves around reading the AFI from the `addressFamily` structure within the IPAddressFamily extension. The AFI is expected to be encoded as the first two bytes of the `addressFamily->data`. In DER, the length of data being not sufficiently validated before these bytes are accessed can lead to the one-byte overread issue described by CVE-2017-3735.

Therefore, while DER itself is not faulty, the mishandling of DER-encoded AFI data within the `addressFamily` structure of the IPAddressFamily extension leads to this vulnerability. Properly validating the length of the DER-encoded `addressFamily->data` before accessing it is crucial to avoid such out-of-bounds reads. This reinforces the importance of robustly handling DER-encoded fields, particularly when parsing complex structures like X.509 certificates where a multitude of extensions and fields must be securely and correctly processed.
