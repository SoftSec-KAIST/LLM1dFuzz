The CVE-2017-3735 vulnerability relates to how OpenSSL handles the `IPAddressFamily` extension within X.509 certificates, specifically when parsing its `addressFamily` field in DER (Distinguished Encoding Rules) format. The DER format is used to convey ASN.1 data structures, which are common in telecommunications and computer networking. The `IPAddressFamily` extension is part of ASN.1 specifications used in X.509 certificates to indicate address families (e.g., IPv4, IPv6) that the certificate is relevant to.

The problematic code before the fix does not adequately validate the length of the `addressFamily` data before attempting to access it. The `addressFamily` field contains the actual address family identifier, which could be a sequence of bytes. In this case, the code attempts to read two bytes from this field to determine the address family identifier (AFI), without ensuring that there are at least two bytes available.

Thus, the specific field in DER related to invoking this CVE is the data part of the `addressFamily` field of an `IPAddressFamily` extension in an X.509 certificate. The vulnerability lies in mishandling the parsing, leading to an out-of-bounds read if the data is not at least two bytes long as expected. This can happen when DER-encoded data representing an X.509 certificate with an `IPAddressFamily` extension is being processed by OpenSSL before the application of the CVE-2017-3735 patch.
