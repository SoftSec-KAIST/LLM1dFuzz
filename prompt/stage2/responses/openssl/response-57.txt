The field in DER (Distinguished Encoding Rules) specifically related to invoking CVE-2017-3735 is within the IPAddressFamily extension in an X.509 certificate. The problematic behavior occurs when parsing the `addressFamily` field, which is a part of the IPAddressFamily extension intended for representing routing or address family information associated with the certificate.

In DER encoding, which is a binary format for data structure encoding, each piece of information is represented in a structured and precise manner, including the length of data segments. The `addressFamily` field should contain data indicating the address family identifier (AFI), which according to the patch requires at least two bytes of data to correctly represent the AFI value. The CVE arises from attempting to read these two bytes without first verifying that there is enough data available in the `addressFamily->data` field, leading to a one-byte overread if the data segment is shorter than expected.

Therefore, when an X.509 certificate includes an IPAddressFamily extension with an `addressFamily` field that is improperly specified (e.g., less than two bytes of data), it triggers the conditions for CVE-2017-3735 upon parsing. This is directly related to how data lengths and content are handled in DER encoding, emphasizing the importance of validating both the presence and size of data in accordance with the expected data structure format.
