This CVE-2017-3735 issue is specifically related to parsing an IPAddressFamily extension in an X.509 certificate. The vulnerability occurs during the handling of the `addressFamily` field, which is a part of the IPAddressFamily extension represented in the Distinguished Encoding Rules (DER) format of an X.509 certificate.

In the context of DER encoding, an X.509 certificate includes various fields encoded in a binary format. The `addressFamily` field within the IPAddressFamily extension is expected to contain at least two bytes of data representing the Address Family Identifier (AFI). The AFI is a part of IP addressing and routing methodologies that associates an IP address with a specific Address Family. This could include, for example, IPv4 or IPv6 amongst others.

The patch demonstrates that originally, there was no verification to ensure the length of the `addressFamily->data` was sufficient before attempting to read from it to construct the AFI value. The vulnerability stems from the handling of this specific DER encoded `addressFamily` field within the IPAddressFamily extension of the X.509 certificate. Insufficient validation allowed an out-of-bounds read by accessing memory beyond what is allocated for `addressFamily->data`, which could then lead to potential errors or misuse in applications relying on OpenSSL for processing such certificates.

Therefore, in terms of DER-related fields, the problematic field is the `addressFamily` field within the IPAddressFamily extension of an X.509 certificate, specifically when it is being parsed without adequate length validation prior to accessing its constituent bytes for constructing the AFI value.
