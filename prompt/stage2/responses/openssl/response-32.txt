The field in DER (Distinguished Encoding Rules) related to invoking CVE-2017-3735 is the `IPAddressFamily` extension in an X.509 certificate. Specifically, the vulnerability is triggered while parsing this extension due to an out-of-bounds read error. The `IPAddressFamily` extension, as part of an X.509 certificate, is used to indicate the address family (e.g., IPv4, IPv6) that the certificate is associated with.

The `addressFamily` field within the `IPAddressFamily` extension is the focal point of this CVE. During the parsing process, if the length of the `addressFamily->data` is not properly checked to ensure it is at least two bytes long before attempting to access the data, a one-byte overread can occur. This is because the code erroneously assumes that there are at least two bytes of data (`data[0]` and `data[1]`) available to be processed for constructing the `afi` (Address Family Indicator) value without performing an adequate length check beforehand.

The patch resolves this by adding a condition that checks if `f->addressFamily->length < 2`, ensuring that there is enough data to safely access without going out of bounds, and thus preventing the vulnerability from being exploited.
