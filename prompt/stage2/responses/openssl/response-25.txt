The field in a Distinguished Encoding Rules (DER) encoded certificate related to invoking CVE-2017-3735 is the "IPAddressFamily" extension within an X.509 certificate. This specific field, part of an X.509 certificate's structure, can trigger the vulnerability when OpenSSL attempts to parse it. The "IPAddressFamily" extension is used in certificates to indicate the address families (e.g., IPv4, IPv6) that the certificate is relevant for, and it includes an "addressFamily" component.

In the context of DER, a binary format for representing data structures described by ASN.1, the critical aspect is how the length and content of the "addressFamily" data are handled. If the DER-encoded information for the "addressFamily" does not ensure at least 2 bytes are available before they are accessed, as was the case before the patch, the parser in OpenSSL could perform a one-byte overread. This overread happens while trying to construct the `afi` (Address Family Indicator) value by directly accessing the first two bytes of the "addressFamily->data" without verifying that these bytes exist, leading to undefined behavior, including potential memory corruption or misinformation displayed from the certificate.

The vulnerability is specifically tied to the parsing mechanism in OpenSSL for extensions within X.509 certificates encoded using DER, where insufficient validation of the length of the "addressFamily" data before accessing it caused the out-of-bound read issue.
