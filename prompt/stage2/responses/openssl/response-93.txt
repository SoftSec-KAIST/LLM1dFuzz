The field in DER (Distinguished Encoding Rules) format related to invoking CVE-2017-3735 is the `addressFamily` field within the IPAddressFamily extension in an X.509 certificate. The vulnerability was triggered when parsing this specific field without properly validating its length, leading to a potential one-byte overread. The `addressFamily` field is intended to specify the address family (e.g., IPv4, IPv6) for the IP addresses included in the certificate. The incorrect handling and insufficient checking of the length of this field before reading its content caused the security issue addressed by the patch.
