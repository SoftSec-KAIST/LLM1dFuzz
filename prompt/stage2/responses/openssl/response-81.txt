The field in DER (Distinguished Encoding Rules) encoding that is directly related to invoking CVE-2017-3735 is the `addressFamily` field within the IPAddressFamily extension of an X.509 certificate. In DER encoding, this field represents the Address Family Identifier (AFI) which is intended to be a two-byte value specifying the address family (e.g., IPv4, IPv6) that the IP address in the certificate belongs to.

When DER-encoded data for an X.509 certificate is being parsed, if the `addressFamily` field of the IPAddressFamily extension is improperly handled, specifically if it does not contain at least two bytes but the parsing logic assumes otherwise, it leads to a one-byte overread vulnerability. This happens because the parsing operation attempts to read two bytes (`data[0]` and `data[1]`) from a section of memory without ensuring those two bytes are valid within the context of the supplied data, leading directly to the conditions that make CVE-2017-3735 exploitable.

To mitigate such vulnerabilities, it is crucial to perform rigorous bounds checks before accessing data buffers, ensuring that any access is safely within the allocated bounds of the data structure being read from or written to. The patch for CVE-2017-3735 addresses this issue by adding a conditional check to confirm the `length` of the `addressFamily->data` is at least 2 bytes, which ensures that the subsequent read operations are safe and eliminates the out-of-bounds read vulnerability created by incorrect assumptions about the data length.
