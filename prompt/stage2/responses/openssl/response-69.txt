The CVE-2017-3735 vulnerability is related to parsing the IPAddressFamily extension in an X.509 certificate, specifically when dealing with the DER (Distinguished Encoding Rules) encoding of this extension. DER is a binary encoding for data structures described by ASN.1 (Abstract Syntax Notation One).

The critical field within the DER encoded structure that contributes to invoking this CVE is the `addressFamily->data` within the IPAddressFamily extension of an X.509 certificate. The vulnerability arises when the OpenSSL code attempts to read two bytes from the `addressFamily->data` for the purpose of constructing an unsigned int representing the address family identifier (AFI). If the length of this data is less than 2 bytes, it leads to a one-byte overread because the code before the fix does not correctly check if there are enough bytes in `addressFamily->data` to safely perform this operation.

The DER encoding of the IPAddressFamily extension would include the `addressFamily` field, and improper handling of this DER-encoded data, especially without verifying the length of the data, can lead to the exploitation of the CVE-2017-3735 vulnerability when OpenSSL processes a crafted X.509 certificate.
