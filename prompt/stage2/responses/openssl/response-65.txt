The CVE-2017-3735 vulnerability relates to parsing the IPAddressFamily extension in an X.509 certificate during the DER (Distinguished Encoding Rules) encoding processing. The IPAddressFamily extension is part of the X.509 Public Key Infrastructure, which includes provisions for including IP addresses and address ranges as part of a certificate's information set, designed to specify the address families (e.g., IPv4, IPv6) that a certificate may be valid for use with.

In the context of DER encoding, this vulnerability specifically pertains to how an X.509 certificate's IPAddressFamily extension is parsed. DER is a binary encoding for data structures described by ASN.1 (Abstract Syntax Notation One). The bug was triggered when the OpenSSL code attempted to read two bytes from the `addressFamily` field within the IPAddressFamily extension without first adequately checking that the data length was sufficient to provide these two bytes. This oversight could lead to an out-of-bounds read, attempting to access memory beyond what was allocated for the `addressFamily` data, due to incorrectly assuming the presence of at least two bytes without verifying.

The field in question, therefore, is the `addressFamily` field within the IPAddressFamily extension of an X.509 certificate, as it's being processed according to the DER encoding rules applied to ASN.1-defined structures. The vulnerability demonstrates the importance of rigorously validating the length of data before access, especially in the context of complex encoded data structures like those found in X.509 certificates.
