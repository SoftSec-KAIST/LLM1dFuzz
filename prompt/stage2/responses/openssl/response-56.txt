The field in DER (Distinguished Encoding Rules) format related to invoking CVE-2017-3735 is the `addressFamily` field within the `IPAddressFamily` extension in an X.509 certificate.

DER is a subset of BER (Basic Encoding Rules) providing a single way to encode an ASN.1 data structure. X.509 certificates, used for establishing SSL/TLS connections and verifying the identity of entities, are encoded using DER for their transmission and storage. The `IPAddressFamily` extension, as part of a certificate, is used to indicate the address family (e.g., IPv4, IPv6) that the certificate is associated with or authorized to represent.

The CVE-2017-3735 flaw arises when parsing this specific `addressFamily` extension, where there's potential for a one-byte overread if the implementation does not correctly check the length of the `addressFamily` data before accessing it. This bug occurs due to the assumption that there are at least two bytes present (`data[0]` and `data[1]`), which may not always be the case, leading to an out-of-bounds read when the code attempts to access these bytes without verifying the actual length of the data.

This vulnerability demonstrates the importance of carefully handling ASN.1 structures and the encoded data within X.509 certificates, especially given their critical role in securing communications over the internet.
