The field in DER (Distinguished Encoding Rules) encoding that is related to invoking CVE-2017-3735 is the IPAddressFamily extension in an X.509 certificate. This vulnerability is triggered when parsing the `addressFamily` field within the IPAddressFamily extension.

DER is a binary format for data structures described by ASN.1 (Abstract Syntax Notation One). An X.509 certificate, which adheres to a specific ASN.1 structure, uses DER for its encoding. The structure of an X.509 certificate includes various extensions that provide additional information and functionality. One such extension is the IPAddressFamily extension, which is intended to specify address families (e.g., IPv4, IPv6) that the certificate is relevant for.

The vulnerability, CVE-2017-3735, occurs due to improper handling of the length check before accessing the `addressFamily` data. Specifically, the bug is triggered by the incorrect assumption that there are at least two bytes available in the `addressFamily->data`, representing the Address Family Identifier (AFI), without verifying that the `addressFamily->length` is sufficient to contain those two bytes. This can lead to a one-byte overread, which happens during the parsing of the `addressFamily` field within the IPAddressFamily extension.

In summary, the critical field in DER encoding related to CVE-2017-3735 is the `addressFamily` data within the IPAddressFamily extension of an X.509 certificate. The flaw stems from not validating the length of this field before attempting to access it, which could lead to memory safety violations.
