The CVE-2017-3735 vulnerability involves parsing an IPAddressFamily extension in an X.509 certificate, specifically relating to how OpenSSL handles the Address Family Identifier (AFI) within the extension. The key field in the DER (Distinguished Encoding Rules) encoded X.509 certificate that is related to invoking this vulnerability would be the `addressFamily` field within the IPAddressFamily extension. 

In DER encoding, an X.509 certificate extension would follow a structured format, where the `addressFamily` field contains an octet string that represents the address family (e.g., IPv4, IPv6) being described. The vulnerability arises when OpenSSL's `X509v3_addr_get_afi` function reads the first two bytes of this `addressFamily` data to determine the AFI without first verifying that there are at least two bytes available to read. Thus, if the DER-encoded `addressFamily` data is malformed or if it legitimately contains less than two bytes, OpenSSL would end up executing a one-byte overread, leading to the security issue described in CVE-2017-3735.

The relevant fix checks the length of the `addressFamily` field (specifically, `f->addressFamily->length`) to ensure it is at least 2 bytes long before proceeding to read from it. In the context of DER, this involves scrutinizing the length descriptor of the `addressFamily` octet string in the IPAddressFamily extension to prevent an out-of-bounds read operation. This careful validation is critical in correctly and safely parsing the structured data within an X.509 certificate's extensions, thereby patching the CVE-2017-3735 vulnerability.
