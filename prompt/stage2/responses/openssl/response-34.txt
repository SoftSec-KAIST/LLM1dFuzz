The CVE-2017-3735 vulnerability is related to the `IPAddressFamily` extension in an X.509 certificate, specifically during the parsing of the `addressFamily` field within this extension.

In ASN.1 notation, which is used for defining the structure of certificates encoded in DER (Distinguished Encoding Rules), an X.509 certificate can include various extensions. One such possible extension contains data about IP address blocks that the certificate is authorized to represent. The `IPAddressFamily` extension includes an `addressFamily` field, which specifies the address family (e.g., IPv4, IPv6) that the extension pertains to. The vulnerability arises when OpenSSL attempts to read the `addressFamily` field from an `IPAddressFamily` extension without first verifying that this field contains enough data to perform the read operation safely.

The DER encoding of the `IPAddressFamily` extension includes the `addressFamily` field, which should have a length of at least 2 bytes to safely perform the operations intended by the affected OpenSSL code. If a maliciously crafted or otherwise anomalous certificate with an `IPAddressFamily` extension has an `addressFamily` field shorter than 2 bytes, this could invoke the vulnerability, leading to a one-byte overread.

This overread could occur because the original code did not adequately validate the length of the `addressFamily->data` before accessing it. The CVE fix involves adding checks to ensure that the `addressFamily` has the required minimum length before proceeding with data access operations, thus preventing potential exploitation through malformed certificates.
