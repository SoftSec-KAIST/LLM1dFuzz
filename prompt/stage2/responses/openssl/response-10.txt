The field in DER (Distinguished Encoding Rules) that is related to invoking CVE-2017-3735 is the `addressFamily` field within the `IPAddressFamily` extension in an X.509 certificate. This specific vulnerability arises when parsing an X.509 certificate that includes an `IPAddressFamily` extension, which is intended to convey information about IP address families for use in applications such as securing network communications.

DER is a binary encoding for data structures described by ASN.1 (Abstract Syntax Notation One). An X.509 certificate, which is a key component in many secure communication protocols, is described using ASN.1 and encoded with DER when transmitted or stored. The `IPAddressFamily` extension, as part of an X.509 certificate, is represented in ASN.1 and thus encoded in DER for transmission or storage.

To delve deeper, the `IPAddressFamily` structure typically includes an `addressFamily` field that identifies the address family (e.g., IPv4, IPv6) relevant to the certificate. In the context of CVE-2017-3735, when the OpenSSL library parses this field from a DER-encoded certificate, it expects at least two bytes of data (as the Address Family Identifier, AFI, is obtained from these bytes). However, before the patch, the library did not properly verify that the `addressFamily` field's length was sufficient, leading to a situation where accessing the second byte (`data[1]`) could result in a one-byte overread if the data were shorter than expected.

In summary, the field related to invoking CVE-2017-3735 in DER is the `addressFamily` field of the `IPAddressFamily` extension in an X.509 certificate, due to insufficient validation of this field's length before attempting to read it.
