The field in DER (Distinguished Encoding Rules) encoding that is related to invoking CVE-2017-3735 is the `addressFamily` field within the IPAddressFamily extension of an X.509 certificate. This field's content is expected to be a series of bytes that indicate the address family (such as IPv4 or IPv6) being used. The vulnerability specifically arises when parsing this `addressFamily` field, which involves reading the first two bytes to determine the address family identifier.

The underlying issue is due to the code not adequately ensuring that the `addressFamily` field contains at least two bytes before attempting to read from it. As a result, if an X.509 certificate is crafted in such a way that the `addressFamily` field's length is less than two bytes, it could trigger a one-byte overread when the OpenSSL library tries to access the second byte (`data[1]`). This improper handling of DER-encoded data in the context of the IPAddressFamily extension is what leads to the vulnerability.

DER encoding is commonly used for encoding the ASN.1 data structures that make up X.509 certificates. These encodings are tightly specified to avoid ambiguities in how data is interpreted. However, the proper parsing and handling of these encodings, particularly with respect to adhering to length specifications and ensuring buffer bounds are respected, is crucial to preventing security vulnerabilities such as CVE-2017-3735.
