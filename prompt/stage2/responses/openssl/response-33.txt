The CVE-2017-3735 vulnerability is related to parsing the IPAddressFamily extension in an X.509 certificate. In the context of DER (Distinguished Encoding Rules) encoding, which is used for encoding the X.509 certificates, the specific field involved in invoking this CVE would be the `addressFamily` field within the IPAddressFamily extension.

The `addressFamily` field is expected to contain an AFI (Address Family Identifier) which is encoded in the first two octets of the `addressFamily` data. The vulnerability arises when processing this part of the certificate, specifically due to insufficient validation of the length of this `addressFamily` data before attempting to read the first two bytes. An attacker could craft a certificate that triggers a one-byte overread by manipulating the length of this field, which would be related to the DER encoding of the extension.

Hence, in DER-encoded data, the vulnerability is directly associated with how the length of the `addressFamily` data is validated before access, rather than a specific field within the DER encoding itself. However, it is the interpretation and processing of this data, based on DER-encoded X.509 certificates, where the issue manifests.
