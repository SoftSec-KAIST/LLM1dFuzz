The vulnerability CVE-2017-3735 is related to parsing the `IPAddressFamily` extension in an X.509 certificate. This extension, in its encoded form, would be part of the DER (Distinguished Encoding Rules) encoded certificate, specifically within the certificate extensions that provide information about the network addresses that the certificate is applicable to.

In DER encoding, the `IPAddressFamily` extension is encoded as part of the X.509 certificate extensions, where it specifies the address family (such as IPv4 or IPv6) and associated addresses or address ranges that the certificate is valid for. The specific field within the `IPAddressFamily` extension that invokes this CVE upon parsing is the `addressFamily` field. This field is expected to contain at least 2 bytes of data to represent the address family identifier (AFI). The CVE is triggered when attempting to read these 2 bytes without first verifying that the `addressFamily->length` is sufficient, leading to a potential one-byte overread if the length is less than 2.

The crucial interaction with DER encoding comes into play when parsing these fields from the encoded certificate. If the encoded `addressFamily` data is shorter than expected (less than 2 bytes), and the code does not properly validate the length before accessing it, it leads to the described vulnerability. Hence, it's the manipulation or interpretation of the DER-encoded `IPAddressFamily` extension, particularly the insufficiently validated `addressFamily` field, that's directly related to invoking CVE-2017-3735.
