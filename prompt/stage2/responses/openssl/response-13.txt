The field in DER (Distinguished Encoding Rules) related to invoking CVE-2017-3735 is the `IPAddressFamily` extension in an X.509 certificate. Specifically, the vulnerability is connected to how OpenSSL processes the `addressFamily` field within the `IPAddressFamily` extension when parsing an X.509 certificate.

Distinguished Encoding Rules (DER) is a binary encoding format for data structures described by ASN.1 (Abstract Syntax Notation One). In the context of X.509 certificates, ASN.1 structures are encoded using DER for transmission and storage. The `IPAddressFamily` extension is part of the X.509 certificate extensions that provide structured information about IP addresses. This extension is involved in scenarios where a certificate is used to establish a secure communication channel and may identify one or more IP addresses or ranges that the certificate is valid for.

The vulnerability arises in the function `X509v3_addr_get_afi`, which is intended to extract the Address Family Identifier (AFI) from the `addressFamily` field of an `IPAddressFamily` structure. Before the patch, there was a lack of a sufficient check on the length of the `addressFamily->data` to ensure it contained at least 2 bytes (necessary for constructing the AFI value). Without this check, attempting to read the AFI value could lead to a one-byte overread if `addressFamily->data` was shorter than expected.

Thus, the `addressFamily` field within the DER-encoded `IPAddressFamily` extension of an X.509 certificate is directly related to this CVE, as improper handling of this part of the DER encoding could trigger the vulnerability during certificate parsing.
