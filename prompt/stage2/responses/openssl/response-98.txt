The CVE (CVE-2017-3735) is associated with the way OpenSSL handles the parsing of an IPAddressFamily extension in an X.509 certificate. Specifically, the vulnerability is related to the processing of the `addressFamily` field within the DER (Distinguished Encoding Rules) encoded representation of the IPAddressFamily extension.

In the context of DER, an X.509 certificate contains various fields encoded according to the ASN.1 specification, which DER is a subset of. The IPAddressFamily extension, part of the Subject Alternative Name (SAN) or similar extensions, includes the `addressFamily` field that indicates the type of IP address (such as IPv4 or IPv6). The `addressFamily` field's data should be correctly sized (at least 2 bytes long in this context) to safely extract and process the address family identifier.

The vulnerability occurs because, before the patch, the OpenSSL code did not properly check the length of the `addressFamily` field's data before attempting to read the first two bytes of this field. If the data was shorter than expected (less than 2 bytes), this would lead to a one-byte overread issue, potentially causing incorrect processing or display of the certificate information related to IP addresses.

Thus, the specific field in DER related to invoking this CVE is the `addressFamily` field within the IPAddressFamily extension of an X.509 certificate, and the vulnerability arises from failing to correctly validate the length of this field before accessing its contents.
