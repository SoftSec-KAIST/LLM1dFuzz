The field in DER (Distinguished Encoding Rules) encoding related to invoking CVE-2017-3735 is the `addressFamily` field within an `IPAddressFamily` structure in an X.509 certificate. Specifically, this vulnerability is triggered when parsing the `IPAddressFamily` extension of the certificate, where an out-of-bounds read can occur if the code does not properly check the length of the `addressFamily` data before accessing it.

DER is a binary encoding for data structures described by ASN.1 (Abstract Syntax Notation One). In the context of X.509 certificates, DER is used to encode all information, including extensions such as the `IPAddressFamily` extension. This extension is designed to specify address families (e.g., IPv4, IPv6) and associated prefixes to indicate IP address blocks or ranges that a certificate is authorized to represent.

The relevant part of the X.509 specification that CVE-2017-3735 pertains to involves how an implementation processes the DER-encoded `addressFamily` field within the IPAddressFamily extension. The vulnerability occurs because the original implementation assumes the presence of at least two bytes of data (`f->addressFamily->data[0]` and `f->addressFamily->data[1]`) without verifying that the `addressFamily->length` field indicates that this minimum data length is indeed available. 

By manipulating a certificate to include an `IPAddressFamily` extension with an `addressFamily` field of less than two bytes, an attacker could exploit this issue, resulting in an out-of-bounds read. This is particularly relevant to DER encoding because DER is strict about encoding structure and data types, but the vulnerability arises from how the application code processes, or in this case, improperly validates, the encoded data. 

In summary, the `addressFamily` field within the `IPAddressFamily` structure of a DER-encoded X.509 certificate is related to invoking CVE-2017-3735, with the root cause being inadequate validation of the length of this field before data access.
