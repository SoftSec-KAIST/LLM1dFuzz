Based on the information related to CVE-2017-3735 and the patch provided for OpenSSL, the vulnerability is specifically associated with the parsing of the IPAddressFamily extension in an X.509 certificate. The critical interaction causing the vulnerability involves the `addressFamily` field within the IPAddressFamily extension. 

In the context of X.509 certificates, data structures are encoded using Distinguished Encoding Rules (DER), a subset of the ASN.1 encoding rules. The `addressFamily` field, which is implicated in this vulnerability, is part of the encoding for the IPAddressFamily extension that would be encoded using DER in an X.509 certificate.

ASN.1 and DER are used universally in cryptographic protocols and formats, including X.509 for public key infrastructure (PKI) to ensure interoperability between different systems. The DER encoding of the `addressFamily` field directly influences how OpenSSL parses it. In the case of CVE-2017-3735, improper validation of the length of the `addressFamily` data when DER-decoded can lead to a one-byte overread. 

The vulnerable function, as noted in the patch, indicates an issue in handling the `addressFamily` data's length validation before reading it. The DER-encoded `addressFamily` requires at least 2 bytes of data to represent a valid AFI (Address Family Identifier). Before the patch, OpenSSL did not verify that the `addressFamily->data` pointed to by the `f->addressFamily` structure's `data` field had sufficient length before attempting to read the first two bytes as a single entity (`((f->addressFamily->data[0] << 8) | (f->addressFamily->data[1]))`). This oversight allows for a situation where, if the actual data were shorter than expected (less than 2 bytes), an out-of-bounds read could occur, thus causing the vulnerability described by CVE-2017-3735. 

Therefore, to succinctly address the question: The field in DER encoding that is directly related to invoking CVE-2017-3735 is the DER-encoded representation of the `addressFamily` field in the IPAddressFamily extension of an X.509 certificate.
