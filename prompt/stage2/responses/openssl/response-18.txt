The vulnerability CVE-2017-3735 is triggered while parsing an `IPAddressFamily` extension in an X.509 certificate. More specifically, it occurs due to a one-byte overread when processing the `addressFamily` data. In ASN.1 notation and its encoding in DER (Distinguished Encoding Rules) format, the length of this field and its proper validation are critical. The root cause of CVE-2017-3735 lies in the failure to verify if the `addressFamily` field's length is sufficient before accessing its data, which can lead to attempting to read beyond the allocated memory space for this field.

The `IPAddressFamily` extension itself is part of the IP Address Delegation extension defined in RFC 3779, which enhances X.509 for IP addresses and AS identifiers. This extension includes an `addressFamily` field that typically specifies the type of IP (IPv4 or IPv6) and additional addressing information relevant for routing and certification purposes.

In the context of DER encoding, every field consists of a type, a length, and a value (TLV). The vulnerability is not directly about the DER encoding but rather the improper handling of the `length` component when accessing the `data` part of the `addressFamily` (which is itself encoded following the DER rules as part of the overall certificate). The insufficient validation check of the `length` before accessing the data leads to the one-byte overread vulnerability. 

Therefore, it's not a specific field in DER that is directly related to invoking this CVE, but rather how the software (OpenSSL) interprets and accesses the length and data of the `addressFamily` within the decoded DER structure of an X.509 certificate's IPAddressFamily extension that leads to the vulnerability.
