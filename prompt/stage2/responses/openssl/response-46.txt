Given the information from the previous discussion about CVE-2017-3735, the vulnerability is related to parsing the IPAddressFamily extension in an X.509 certificate. More specifically, the issue occurs while dealing with the `addressFamily` field within the `IPAddressFamily` structure or extension.

In the context of DER (Distinguished Encoding Rules), which is a subset of ASN.1 (Abstract Syntax Notation One) used for encoding ASN.1 objects, the relevant field that triggers this CVE when improperly parsed is the `addressFamily` field of an IPAddressFamily extension in X.509 certificates. The `addressFamily` field contains an AFI (Address Family Identifier) which is expected to be represented by two bytes within the ASN.1 DER encoding of the certificate.

DER encoding is critical for defining the exact way that structures like X.509 certificates are to be serialized for storage or transmission. Each field, including those within complex extensions like IPAddressFamily, must be carefully parsed in accordance with DER's strict rules to prevent errors like the one-byte overread described by CVE-2017-3735.

The vulnerability specifically arises from not checking that the length of the `addressFamily` data is sufficient (at least two bytes) before attempting to read its value. This is a direct consequence of mishandling the DER-encoded data of the certificate, particularly the part that encodes the `addressFamily` information within the IPAddressFamily extension.
