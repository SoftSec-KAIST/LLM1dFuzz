The CVE-2017-3735 can be invoked when dealing with the `IPAddressFamily` extension in an X.509 certificate. Specifically, the vulnerability arises during the parsing of this extension, due to insufficient boundary checks before reading the `addressFamily` field's data. In DER (Distinguished Encoding Rules) encoding, which is a binary encoding for data structures described by ASN.1, the `IPAddressFamily` extension would be represented as part of the overall certificate structure.

The `addressFamily` data is part of the `IPAddressFamily` extension and is intended to indicate the type of IP addresses (IPv4, IPv6, etc.) that are being represented. In the context of a DER-encoded X.509 certificate, data fields like this are typically represented with a type, length, and value structure (TLV). Misinterpreting the length or incorrectly handling it can lead to errors such as the one-byte overread described in CVE-2017-3735.

Therefore, while the CVE directly relates to the handling of an `IPAddressFamily` extension's `addressFamily` field data within the OpenSSL library, this vulnerability would manifest during the parsing of the DER-encoded X.509 certificate that contains this specific extension. The flaw is not in the DER encoding itself but in how the encoded data is parsed and validated by the affected OpenSSL functions.
