The field in DER (Distinguished Encoding Rules) encoding that is related to invoking CVE-2017-3735 is the `addressFamily` field within the IPAddressFamily extension of an X.509 certificate. This vulnerability is specifically related to how OpenSSL parses the `addressFamily` field when handling an IPAddressFamily extension.

In the context of an X.509 certificate, extensions allow for various functionalities to be added to certificates for different purposes. One such extension is the IPAddressFamily extension, which can include information about IP address ranges that are considered valid for the certificate. The `addressFamily` field within this extension indicates the type of IP addresses (e.g., IPv4, IPv6) the certificate is associated with.

The DER encoding ensures that the data is unambiguously encoded, which includes specifying the length of each piece of information. However, before the patch for CVE-2017-3735, OpenSSL did not adequately check that the length of the `addressFamily` data was sufficient (at least 2 bytes) before reading from it. This oversight led to the possibility of a one-byte overread, which could occur if a crafted certificate presented an `addressFamily` field with a length less than 2 bytes. This vulnerability underscores the importance of rigorously validating the length of data fields when parsing structured data, especially in security-critical contexts such as parsing X.509 certificates.
