The field in Distinguished Encoding Rules (DER) format that is related to invoking CVE-2017-3735 is the `addressFamily` field within the IPAddressFamily extension of an X.509 certificate. DER is a binary encoding for data structures described by ASN.1 (Abstract Syntax Notation One). The vulnerability specifically centers on how OpenSSL, before the patch, parses the `addressFamily` field without properly checking its length, leading to the potential for a one-byte overread.

The IPAddressFamily extension is used in X.509 certificates to indicate the address family (e.g., IPv4 or IPv6) that the certificate is associated with. This field is expected to contain at least two bytes of data (to represent the address family identifier), which are then read and combined to form the address family's actual identity.

In the context of this CVE, when a malformed or specially crafted X.509 certificate that contains an IPAddressFamily extension with an `addressFamily` field of less than two bytes is parsed by a vulnerable version of OpenSSL, it triggers the out-of-bounds read. This happens because the original code did not verify that the `addressFamily->length` was at least two before attempting to read the two bytes to construct the address family identifier.

This lack of bound checking against the actual length of the `addressFamily->data` buffer in the DER representation of the X.509 certificate is the direct cause of CVE-2017-3735. The patch corrects this by adding the necessary checks to ensure that there are at least two bytes available before accessing the `addressFamily->data` buffer, thus avoiding the out-of-bounds read operation.
