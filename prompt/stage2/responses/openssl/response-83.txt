The CVE-2017-3735 is related to parsing the `IPAddressFamily` extension within an X.509 certificate. Based on the information provided and the nature of the vulnerability, the specifically related field within the Distinguished Encoding Rules (DER) serialization that could invoke this CVE is the `addressFamily` field of the `IPAddressFamily` extension.

When an X.509 certificate contains an `IPAddressFamily` extension, it includes an `addressFamily` component comprising a sequence of bytes. This sequence ought to indicate aspects such as the address family (e.g., IPv4, IPv6) and potentially additional information relevant to the routing or processing of the certificate. The vulnerability arises when the OpenSSL code processes this `addressFamily` data without properly ensuring that this sequence is of the expected length (at least 2 bytes long) before accessing it.

DER is a binary encoding for data structures described by ASN.1 (Abstract Syntax Notation One). The `addressFamily` data within an `IPAddressFamily` extension would be encoded according to DER specifications, and its content, including length and actual data, is critical for correctly parsing and handling by the OpenSSL library.

Therefore, the exploitation of CVE-2017-3735 could be specifically triggered by crafting a certificate where the DER-encoded `IPAddressFamily` extension's `addressFamily` field is malformed, such as having a shorter length than expected, which would lead to an out-of-bounds read when OpenSSL attempts to process it without the now-implemented length check.
