The field in DER (Distinguished Encoding Rules) encoding related to invoking CVE-2017-3735 is the IPAddressFamily extension in an X.509 certificate. The vulnerability specifically arises while parsing the `addressFamily` field within the IPAddressFamily extension.

DER is a binary encoding for data structures described by ASN.1 (Abstract Syntax Notation One). X.509 certificates, which are used for public key infrastructure (PKI) to secure communication over networks, utilize DER encoding for their transmission and storage format. The IPAddressFamily extension is part of the IP address delegation extension and is used to indicate the address family (e.g., IPv4, IPv6) that the certificate is authorized to represent.

The CVE-2017-3735 vulnerability stems from not properly checking the length of the `addressFamily` field's data in the DER-encoded certificate before attempting to read it. This oversight leads to a potential one-byte overread, which occurs when the code attempts to access data beyond the allocated bounds of the `addressFamily` data array. Correct handling of such fields in DER requires ensuring that the length of data matches the expected length before accessing specific elements within the data array, to avoid out-of-bounds memory access.

This specific field is critical for invoking CVE-2017-3735 due to its role in the parsing process, where an incorrect assumption about its size without proper validation leads to the described vulnerability.
