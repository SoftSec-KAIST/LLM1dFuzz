The field in DER (Distinguished Encoding Rules) that is related to invoking CVE-2017-3735 is the `addressFamily` field within the `IPAddressFamily` extension of an X.509 certificate. The issue arises during the parsing of this extension, specifically when reading the `addressFamily` field's data without properly verifying if the field contains enough bytes to perform the operation.

In context, X.509 certificates can include various extensions for different purposes. The `IPAddressFamily` extension allows the certificate to specify a range of IP addresses that the certificate is valid for, identifying the address family (e.g., IPv4, IPv6) to which the IP addresses belong. The DER encoding of this field is intended to represent the address family identifier, which requires at least two bytes of data to specify the family correctly.

However, before the patch for CVE-2017-3735 was applied, the OpenSSL code did not check that the `addressFamily` field's `length` was sufficient to cover these two bytes before attempting to read them. This misstep could lead to a one-byte overread if the `addressFamily` field was shorter than expected, which could result in erroneous behavior or information disclosure depending on the nature of the adjacent memory content.
