The field in DER (Distinguished Encoding Rules) format that is related to invoking CVE-2017-3735 is the `addressFamily` field within the `IPAddressFamily` extension of an X.509 certificate. DER is a binary encoding for data structures described by ASN.1 (Abstract Syntax Notation One). X.509 certificates, which are used for public key infrastructure (PKI) to secure communication over networks, utilize DER for their encoding.

The `addressFamily` field is intended to represent the address family (e.g., IPv4, IPv6) for which an IP address, or a range of IP addresses, is valid in the context of the certificate. However, due to the bug, if this field's length was less than the expected 2 bytes (which are necessary to properly identify an address family according to the logic before the fix), but the field was nonetheless accessed as if it contained at least 2 bytes, an out-of-bounds read could occur. This happens because the code prior to the fix did not check if the `addressFamily->length` was at least 2, leading to scenarios where processing a specially crafted X.509 certificate could result in an incorrect display of the certificate or potentially more severe impacts depending on the application's response to the malformed data.

So, in summary, the `addressFamily` field in the `IPAddressFamily` extension of an X.509 certificate, when encoded using DER and not properly validated for length in the affected versions of OpenSSL, is directly related to triggering CVE-2017-3735.
