The CVE-2017-3735 vulnerability is associated with the IPAddressFamily extension in an X.509 certificate. The specific field within the Distinguished Encoding Rules (DER)-encoded structure that's related to invoking this CVE is the `addressFamily` field.

In the context of DER, an X.509 certificate uses a specific syntax to represent various information fields, including extensions that can carry additional data. The `IPAddressFamily` extension is used to express IP addresses and AS identifiers associated with a certificate, and it is structured to include an `addressFamily` field. This field represents the type of address (such as IPv4 or IPv6) that the certificate is associated with.

The vulnerability arises when OpenSSL processes this `IPAddressFamily` extension. The root cause, as identified, is a lack of proper validation of the length of the `addressFamily` data before attempting to read the first two bytes of it. DER encoding ensures that each data element in the certificate is marked with a type and length. However, if the `addressFamily`'s length is insufficient (less than two bytes) and the code attempts to read two bytes without checking the actual length, it leads to a one-byte overread. This operation was expected to safely extract the address family identifier (AFI) from the `addressFamily` field, but due to improper validation, it could access memory beyond the intended buffer.

In essence, it is the improper handling of the `addressFamily` field within the DER-encoded `IPAddressFamily` extension of an X.509 certificate that relates to invoking CVE-2017-3735 when parsed by OpenSSL versions prior to 1.0.2m and 1.1.0g.
