The CVE-2017-3735 vulnerability is related to the handling of the `IPAddressFamily` extension in an X.509 certificate, specifically during the parsing of this extension. The `IPAddressFamily` extension, according to the context provided, includes an `addressFamily` field. From the provided patch information, the issue arises when the code attempts to construct an address family identifier from the data in the `addressFamily` field without first validating that there is sufficient data to do so.

In the context of DER (Distinguished Encoding Rules), which is used for encoding the ASN.1 defined structures in X.509 certificates, the vulnerability would be triggered when processing the fields of an `IPAddressFamily` extension that is encoded in a certificate. The problem occurs because the DER encoding of the `addressFamily` field might indicate a shorter length than expected, but the original code did not properly check this length before trying to access the data. The `addressFamily` field's improper validation and the subsequent one-byte overread are where the problem lies.

So, in terms of DER encoding, it is the length and content of the encoded `addressFamily` field within the `IPAddressFamily` extension that is directly related to invoking this CVE. Properly encoded DER data should include length information for each field, which the vulnerable OpenSSL code did not correctly validate before attempting to read from the `addressFamily` data.
