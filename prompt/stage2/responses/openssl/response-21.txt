The field in DER (Distinguished Encoding Rules) related to invoking CVE-2017-3735 lies within the `IPAddressFamily` extension of an X.509 certificate. Specifically, this vulnerability concerns the `addressFamily` field, which is part of the `IPAddressFamily` structure being parsed.

The issue occurs while parsing the `addressFamily` field if it’s improperly validated — more precisely, the code did not sufficiently check the length of the `addressFamily->data` before attempting to read the two bytes representing the AFI (Address Family Identifier). DER is a binary format for data structures described by ASN.1 (Abstract Syntax Notation One), and X.509 certificates use this notation and encoding rules to represent the certificate information.

In summary, the vulnerability stems from mishandling the parsing of the `addressFamily` field within the `IPAddressFamily` extension in DER-encoded X.509 certificates. Insufficient validation of the length of this field before accessing its data can lead to a one-byte overread, notably invoking CVE-2017-3735 during the certificate's parsing process.
