Based on the information provided in the previous discussion about CVE-2017-3735, the vulnerability revolves around the parsing of the IPAddressFamily extension in an X.509 certificate. The specific issue is tied to how OpenSSL, before versions 1.0.2m and 1.1.0g, handles the `addressFamily` field within this extension.

In terms of DER (Distinguished Encoding Rules), which is a subset of ASN.1 (Abstract Syntax Notation One) used for encoding the X.509 certificates, the `addressFamily` field that triggers this CVE would be encoded within the IPAddressFamily extension of a certificate. ASN.1 uses DER for the actual encoding which follows strict rules, for example, regarding the lengths of fields and how they are to be interpreted.

To be more precise, the `addressFamily` field, as part of theIPAddressFamily extension (not a standard field in X.509 certificates but part of an extension for representing IP addresses), when improperly validated for length before access, leads to the vulnerability.

DER encodes each piece of data along with its type and length, ensuring that the encoded structure is unambiguous. The vulnerability was caused by a failure to properly check that the `addressFamily` field's length was sufficient before attempting to read two bytes from it. Given DER's encoding rules, any field, including `addressFamily`, should have a defined length. The improper handling in this case allowed for a one-byte overread, implying an issue in how the DER-encoded length and content of the `addressFamily` field were processed.

Hence, while the CVE isn't about DER encoding per se, the encoding of the `addressFamily` field in DER format within the certificate plays a central role in how this flaw is triggered, because it's the interpretation (parsing) of this DER-encoded field where the vulnerability occurs.
