The field in Distinguished Encoding Rules (DER) related to invoking CVE-2017-3735 is the `IPAddressFamily` extension in an X.509 certificate. The vulnerability specifically concerns the parsing of this extension's data, where a one-byte overread can occur due to insufficient validation of the `addressFamily`'s data length. In the context of DER encoding, which is used for encoding the ASN.1 specified structures in X.509 certificates, this vulnerability highlights the importance of properly handling the length and content of such encoded data.

The `IPAddressFamily` extension, as part of the X.509 certificate, can contain information about IP address ranges that are associated with a certificate for purposes like securing IP-based network communication. The parsing process of this extension, as detailed in the patch, must ensure that there is enough data available to construct the address family identifier correctly. Prior to the patch, the code didn't adequately verify that the `addressFamily` data was long enough to prevent reading beyond its allocated boundary, which is critical in the context of DER-encoded data where each field's length must be explicitly managed to maintain data integrity and security.
