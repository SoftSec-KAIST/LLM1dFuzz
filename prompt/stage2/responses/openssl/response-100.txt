The CVE-2017-3735 vulnerability pertains to the parsing of the IPAddressFamily extension in an X.509 certificate. The specific field in Distinguished Encoding Rules (DER) encoding related to invoking this CVE is the `addressFamily` field within the IPAddressFamily extension.

The `addressFamily` field is expected to contain data representing the Address Family Identifier (AFI), which is a part of the routing information contained in the certificate. The AFI is intended to be a two-byte value. However, without proper validation that ensures the `addressFamily` field's `length` is at least two bytes before attempting to read these two bytes, there's a risk of a one-byte overread. This oversight allows for the vulnerability, as the code may attempt to read beyond the bounds of the allocated memory for the `addressFamily` field if it contains less than two bytes.

DER encoding is a method for representing data structures in a manner that is precise and avoids ambiguities, part of the X.690 specification. It's widely used in security protocols, including TLS/SSL, which relies on X.509 certificates for Public Key Infrastructure (PKI). When parsing such encoded data, strict adherence to expected lengths and values is crucial for security. Failure to properly validate these can lead to vulnerabilities such as CVE-2017-3735.

In summary, within the context of DER-encoded X.509 certificates, the `addressFamily` field of the IPAddressFamily extension is directly related to the triggering of CVE-2017-3735 due to insufficient validation before accessing its contents.
