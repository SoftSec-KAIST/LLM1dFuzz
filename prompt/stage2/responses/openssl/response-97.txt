The CVE-2017-3735 vulnerability is specifically related to the handling of an `IPAddressFamily` extension within an X.509 certificate in OpenSSL. The root cause of this vulnerability is an insufficient validation when parsing the `addressFamily` field of an X.509 certificate's `IPAddressFamily` extension.

In DER (Distinguished Encoding Rules), which is a binary encoding for data structures described by ASN.1 (Abstract Syntax Notation One), an `IPAddressFamily` extension includes an `addressFamily` field. This field is where the vulnerability occurs due to a one-byte overread while parsing the extension. DER encoding is used for encoding the X.509 certificates, and within this context, the `addressFamily` field is expected to be at least 2 bytes long since it's being accessed with `data[0]` and `data[1]`. However, before the patch, the code did not adequately ensure that this field's length was checked before trying to access these bytes, leading to the vulnerability.

This specific issue with the `addressFamily` field handling demonstrates how critical proper length validation is in securely parsing structured data encoded in formats like DER, especially within security-sensitive functionalities like certificate validation in cryptographic libraries.
