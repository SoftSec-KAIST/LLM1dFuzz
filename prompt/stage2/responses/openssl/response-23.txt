The vulnerability tied to CVE-2017-3735 is specifically related to the parsing of the `IPAddressFamily` extension within an X.509 certificate. In the context of Distinguished Encoding Rules (DER), which are a subset of ASN.1 encoding rules used to encode the data in X.509 certificates, the field that directly relates to invoking this CVE would be within the `addressFamily` data of the `IPAddressFamily` structure.

In ASN.1/DER encoding, an X.509 certificate consists of various fields encoded in a binary format. The `IPAddressFamily` extension is part of the certificate extensions that provide additional capabilities and information, like associating an IP address with a certificate. Each extension in an X.509 certificate is tagged and has its length defined according to DER conventions.

The `addressFamily` field within `IPAddressFamily` would typically contain the address family identifier (AFI) information indicating the type of address (e.g., IPv4, IPv6) being represented. The vulnerability described in CVE-2017-3735 arises from mishandling when this specific `addressFamily` field's length is not properly checked before attempting to read two bytes of data from it. If the actual length is less than two bytes, it results in a one-byte overread, as the software incorrectly assumes there are at least two bytes available to construct the AFI.

Thus, the DER-encoded `addressFamily` field in the `IPAddressFamily` extension of an X.509 certificate is directly related to invoking this CVE due to improper length checks and assumptions made about the presence and size of data in this field.
