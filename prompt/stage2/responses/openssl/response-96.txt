The vulnerability CVE-2017-3735 is related to parsing the `IPAddressFamily` extension within an X.509 certificate. In the context of DER (Distinguished Encoding Rules), which is used for the encoding of X.509 certificates, the specific field within this extension that could invoke this CVE is the `addressFamily` field.

This `addressFamily` field is intended to represent the address family (e.g., IPv4, IPv6) of the IP addresses contained within the certificate. However, the vulnerability arises when the data length of this `addressFamily` field is not properly validated before being accessed. In DER encoding, each field is typically accompanied by its length, but the original code did not check that the `addressFamily->length` was sufficient (at least 2 bytes as expected for a correct read operation) before attempting to read two bytes from its data. Therefore, directly interacting with the `addressFamily` field, specifically its length and associated data without proper validation, is related to invoking the mentioned CVE.

In summary, manipulating the DER-encoded data of the `addressFamily` field in an `IPAddressFamily` extension, especially by providing data that is shorter than expected (less than 2 bytes), would exploit the vulnerability detailed in CVE-2017-3735 prior to the application of the patch.
