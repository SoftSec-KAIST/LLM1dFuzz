The CVE-2017-3735 vulnerability is related to the parsing of an `IPAddressFamily` extension in an X.509 certificate. Specifically, it concerns an overread issue when interpreting the `addressFamily` field within this extension. In terms of DER (Distinguished Encoding Rules), which is a binary encoding for data structures described by ASN.1 (Abstract Syntax Notation One), the vulnerability revolves around how OpenSSL handles the length and content of the `addressFamily` field's data when encoded in DER format.

The `IPAddressFamily` extension comprises an `addressFamily` field, which encodes routing information. This field should contain at least two bytes of data representing the AFI (Address Family Identifier). However, the vulnerability arises from the software's assumption that there are at least two bytes present without verifying the actual length of the encoded data. This checks the actual bytes present in the DER-encoded `addressFamily` data before processing it.

In DER encoding, each piece of information is typically encoded with a type, length, and value. The oversight in OpenSSL before the vulnerability was addressed did not properly validate the 'length' part for this specific field, assuming a length that could lead to an attempt to read beyond the available data. Thus, the DER-encoded `addressFamily` field within the `IPAddressFamily` extension is what's directly related to invoking CVE-2017-3735 due to improper length verification upon parsing.
