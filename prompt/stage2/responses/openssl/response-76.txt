The field in DER (Distinguished Encoding Rules) encoding that is related to invoking CVE-2017-3735 lies within the `IPAddressFamily` extension in an X.509 certificate, more specifically, the `addressFamily` field.

The DER encoding is a subset of the ASN.1 (Abstract Syntax Notation One) specification used for encoding X.509 certificates. These certificates contain various extensions that provide additional information and capabilities beyond the basic certificate. One such extension is the `IPAddressFamily` extension, which includes the `addressFamily` field intended for specifying the address family (e.g., IPv4, IPv6) for which the certificate is valid.

The vulnerability is tied to improperly handling the length of the `addressFamily` data. According to the patch mentioned in the previous discussion, OpenSSL before versions 1.0.2m and 1.1.0g did not properly check if the `addressFamily` field's data length was sufficient before reading two bytes of data from it. This could lead to a one-byte overread if the actual data was shorter than expected, because the DER-encoded data might not contain the expected length of bytes for the `addressFamily`, yet the OpenSSL code attempted to read two bytes without verifying the available length.

In DER encoding, each field typically consists of a tag, a length, and a value (TLV). The vulnerability here presumably involves the "length" part of the TLV structure not being adequately checked before accessing the "value" for the `addressFamily`, resulting in potential undefined behavior or security vulnerabilities if the data is malformed or intentionally crafted to exploit this oversight.
