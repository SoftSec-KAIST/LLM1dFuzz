The CVE-2017-3735 vulnerability is related to the parsing of an `IPAddressFamily` extension in an X.509 certificate. The specific field within the Distinguished Encoding Rules (DER) encoded representation of an X.509 certificate that triggers this vulnerability is the `addressFamily` field of the `IPAddressFamily` extension.

DER is a binary encoding for data structures described by ASN.1 (Abstract Syntax Notation One). An X.509 certificate, which uses ASN.1 for its structure, can contain various extensions defined in the X.509 standard for adding additional information about the certificate subject, issuer, or the certificate's intended usage. One such extension can include information about IP address blocks that the certificate is authorized to represent, specified using the `IPAddressFamily` extension. 

The `addressFamily` field within this extension is intended to denote the type of IP addresses (e.g., IPv4, IPv6) the following addresses relate to by specifying an Address Family Identifier (AFI). This field is encoded in DER as part of the overall certificate. The vulnerability arises when OpenSSL attempts to extract the AFI value from this field without verifying that the encoded `addressFamily` data is long enough to contain the expected two bytes for the AFI. Reading this field without properly checking its length leads to the possibility of a one-byte overread, constituting this vulnerability.

This specific vulnerability is triggered when handling the `addressFamily` field not according to its length in the DER encoding but assuming the presence of at least two bytes without verification, leading to the CVE in question when processing malformed certificates.
