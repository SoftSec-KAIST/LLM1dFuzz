The CVE-2017-3735 vulnerability is related to parsing the IPAddressFamily extension in an X.509 certificate within OpenSSL. The specific field in DER (Distinguished Encoding Rules) encoding that's related to invoking this CVE is within the `addressFamily` part of the IPAddressFamily extension. The vulnerability occurs during the read operation on the `addressFamily->data` field.

In the context of DER, the `addressFamily` is part of the encoded data of an X.509 certificate extension, where the extension itself is serialized using DER. When OpenSSL parses this extension, it expects to find an `addressFamily` field encoded in the certificate. The error is triggered during the handling of this serialized data: the faulty assumption is that there are at least two bytes available to represent the address family identifier, which leads to a one-byte overread if the actual length of `addressFamily->data` is less than two bytes.

This issue specifically involves how OpenSSL processes this DER-encoded information upon encountering the IPAddressFamily extension. DER encoding is used to achieve a unique encoding, which is critical for the security of SSL/TLS connections and the validation of X.509 certificates. Malformed or maliciously crafted certificates exploiting this vulnerability could lead to incorrect processing and potentially to more severe security consequences depending on how the overread data is used by applications.
