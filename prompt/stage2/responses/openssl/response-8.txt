The CVE-2017-3735 vulnerability is related to how OpenSSL parses the IPAddressFamily extension in an X.509 certificate. Specifically, the vulnerability is triggered when parsing the `addressFamily` component of this extension. The `addressFamily` is a field within the IPAddressFamily extension structure that represents the type of address (e.g., IPv4, IPv6) contained within the certificate.

In DER (Distinguished Encoding Rules) encoding, which is used for encoding X.509 certificates, the `addressFamily` field would be part of the encoded data for the IPAddressFamily extension. The vulnerability stems from a failure to properly check the length of the `addressFamily` data before attempting to read two bytes from it. Due to this oversight, an out-of-bounds read could occur if the `addressFamily` data was less than two bytes long, which could happen with improperly structured or maliciously crafted certificates.

Thus, it is the `addressFamily` field within the DER-encoded IPAddressFamily extension of an X.509 certificate that is directly related to invoking the CVE-2017-3735 vulnerability.
