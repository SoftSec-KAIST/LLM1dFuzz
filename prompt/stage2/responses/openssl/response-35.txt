The field in DER (Distinguished Encoding Rules) related to invoking CVE-2017-3735 is the `IPAddressFamily` extension in an X.509 certificate. This extension is part of the certificate's structure used to represent address families (such as IPv4 or IPv6) for various operations, including secure communications and authentication processes.

The `IPAddressFamily` extension contains the `addressFamily` field, which is expected to include at least two bytes of data representing the address family identifier (AFI). The vulnerability arises when the code does not validate that this `addressFamily` field contains the required minimum length of data before attempting to read from it. As such, when an X.509 certificate includes an `IPAddressFamily` extension with an `addressFamily` field that is shorter than expected (less than 2 bytes), the faulty code would proceed to read beyond the allocated memory for this field, causing a one-byte overread. This behavior is what the CVE specifically addresses.

The patch fixes this issue by adding a check to ensure that the `addressFamily` field's length is at least two bytes before any attempt to read its content, thereby avoiding the risk of out-of-bounds memory access that could lead to incorrect information display or potentially more severe impacts depending on the context of the use of the affected OpenSSL library.
