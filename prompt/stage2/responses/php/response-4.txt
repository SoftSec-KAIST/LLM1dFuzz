The CVE-2019-11041 is related to the parsing of EXIF information from an image, specifically via the `exif_read_data()` function in PHP. Given the context of the vulnerability and the nature of the fix provided in the patch, the issue specifically manifests when PHP's EXIF extension handles the thumbnail data embedded within an image's EXIF metadata. 

In the provided patch details, the focus is on checking the size of the `Thumbnail.size` field before proceeding with any further processing:

```diff
-       if (!data) {
+       if (!data || ImageInfo->Thumbnail.size < 4) {
                return FALSE; /* nothing to do here */
```

This suggests that the vulnerability is related to how thumbnail data within the EXIF information is processed. Incorrect handling or insufficient validation of the thumbnail size could lead to an attempt to access or read beyond the allocated buffer when parsing thumbnail data. 

Therefore, it can be inferred that the field in EXIF related to invoking this CVE is the thumbnail data size, which is part of the structure or fields that manage or represent the thumbnail image data within the EXIF metadata of an image. Without proper validation of this data size, malformed or maliciously crafted images could exploit the vulnerability to cause buffer overflow issues, potentially leading to information disclosure or crashes.
