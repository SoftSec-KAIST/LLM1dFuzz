The field in EXIF data related to invoking CVE-2019-11041 is the thumbnail image data within the EXIF information of an image. Specifically, the vulnerability is triggered when parsing the EXIF information that includes the thumbnail data, using the `exif_read_data()` function in PHP. 

From the provided patch details, the fix involves additional checks related to `ImageInfo->Thumbnail.size`. This implies that the issue pertains to how the thumbnail size is handled or verified before being read. The vulnerability arises when the code attempts to access or process the thumbnail without properly verifying that the size of the thumbnail data is within expected boundaries. This could lead to a situation where the program reads beyond the allocated buffer if the thumbnail size is not accurately checked, potentially leading to heap buffer overflow, information disclosure, or a crash.

Therefore, any EXIF field that directly relates to the size or presence of thumbnail data could be involved in triggering this vulnerability if malformed or crafted maliciously.
