The CVE-2019-11041 vulnerability is associated with the handling of EXIF thumbnail data in the PHP's EXIF extension. The problem manifests when parsing the thumbnail information embedded within an image's EXIF data, specifically when using the `exif_read_data()` function to parse this EXIF information. Based on the description and provided patch details, it's evident that the vulnerability occurs during the process of scanning the thumbnail (`exif_scan_thumbnail` function) for EXIF data.

The critical code change in the patch checks for the size of the `Thumbnail` before attempting to parse it, which implies that the related field in EXIF data triggering this vulnerability is the thumbnail image data itself. This data is a visual representation (though at a significantly reduced resolution) of the main image, stored within the EXIF metadata segment of a file. 

Thus, the specific EXIF field related to this CVE is the thumbnail image data stored within the EXIF metadata, which is intended to provide a quick preview of the image without the need to process the entire image file. Malformed or specially crafted thumbnail data can exploit this vulnerability before the patch is applied.
