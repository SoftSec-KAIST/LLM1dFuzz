The vulnerability described in CVE-2019-11041 is related to parsing EXIF information, specifically when handling thumbnail data within the EXIF information of an image. The handling of this thumbnail data in the PHP EXIF extension's function `exif_scan_thumbnail` is where the issue occurs.

Based on the provided information and patch:

```diff
-       if (!data) {
+       if (!data || ImageInfo->Thumbnail.size < 4) {
                return FALSE; /* nothing to do here */
        }
```

The crucial part of the EXIF data related to this vulnerability is the thumbnail's size and content. The `ImageInfo->Thumbnail.size` check added in the patch suggests that the vulnerability is triggered when dealing with the thumbnail informationâ€”specifically, the size of the thumbnail is crucial here. The code before the patch did not adequately verify that the size of the thumbnail data was large enough for the operations that followed, which could lead to an attempt to read or process data beyond the allocated buffer, hence causing a heap buffer overflow.

To sum up, the EXIF field related to invoking CVE-2019-11041 appears to be the size and content of the thumbnail image data contained within the EXIF metadata of a larger image file. This vulnerability is invoked when parsing this thumbnail data without proper validation of its size, leading to potential memory safety issues.
