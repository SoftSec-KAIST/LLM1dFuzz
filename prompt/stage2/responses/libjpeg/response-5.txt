Apologies for any confusion in my previous response. As per the clarification, the root cause of CVE-2018-14498 indeed lies in the missing validity check for color indices that are larger than the color map length in the handling of BMP files. This specifically pertains to how 8-bit BMP files use their color indices to reference colors in a color palette (color map).

The field in the BMP file format that is directly related to invoking this CVE is the "biClrUsed" field. This field specifies the number of colors in the color palette (color map) used by the BMP image. When processing an 8-bit BMP file, each pixel's value is an index into this color palette. If a pixel value (color index) exceeds the number of colors specified by "biClrUsed," it results in an attempt to access the color palette array out of its bounds, potentially leading to a heap-based buffer over-read and consequently to a Denial of Service (application crash).

To prevent this vulnerability, the software needs to check that each color index referenced by the pixel data is within the range specified by the "biClrUsed" field (i.e., less than the number of colors in the color map). The patch for this CVE adds such a check to ensure that color indices do not go beyond the bounds of the color map, which is crucial for preventing out-of-bounds memory access.
