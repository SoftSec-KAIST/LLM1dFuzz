The field in BMP (Bitmap) files that is directly related to invoking CVE-2018-14498 is the color index data in an 8-bit-per-sample BMP file. Specifically, the vulnerability is triggered when attempting to process BMP files where one or more of these color indices exceed the bounds of the BMP file's color table. 

To elaborate, an 8-bit BMP image uses a color palette (color table) where each byte in the image data represents an index into this color table. The size (number of entries) of this color table is a critical factor in safely processing the BMP file. If an image data byte (color index) refers to a position outside the actual bounds of this color table, it leads to an attempt to read memory beyond the allocated space for the color table, thus causing an out-of-bounds read issue. 

The related field that determines the number of color entries in the color table is part of the BMP file header, specifically the `biClrUsed` field of the BITMAPINFOHEADER structure. This field specifies the number of colors in the color table that are actually used by the bitmap. If `biClrUsed` is set to zero, the BMP file is assumed to use the maximum number of colors corresponding to the bit depth (e.g., 256 colors for 8-bit BMP files). 

However, regardless of the `biClrUsed` field's value, if an 8-bit BMP file contains color indices that refer to positions beyond the available entries in the color palette (either the actual count specified by `biClrUsed` or the maximum count for the given bit depth), it would exploit CVE-2018-14498 due to the improper handling of these out-of-range color indices before the patch was applied. The patch mitigates this vulnerability by checking that each color index is within the bounds of the color palette before attempting to access the color value from the palette, as indicated by the corrected handling in the `rdbmp.c` source file changes.
