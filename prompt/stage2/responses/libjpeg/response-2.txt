The field in BMP files that is related to invoking CVE-2018-14498 is the color index (or indices) used in 8-bit BMP files. These indices refer to entries within the BMP file's color table (palette). The vulnerability arises when one or more of these color indices exceed the actual number of entries in the color table, causing an out-of-bounds read.

Specifically, the issue is triggered when processing 8-bit-per-sample BMP files, where each pixel's value in the image data represents an index into a color table defining what color the pixel should display. This color table allows for a limited number of unique colors (the exact number is specified by another field in the BMP file header, typically `biClrUsed`). The core problem leading to CVE-2018-14498 occurs when the color index value for one or more pixels is larger than the maximum index allowable by the size of the color table, which leads to attempting to read beyond the bounds of the color table array stored in memory.

To safeguard against this vulnerability, validation checks were introduced in the patch to ensure that all color indices used in the image data are within the valid range of the color table before they are used to access colors from the table. This prevents the out-of-bounds read condition that could lead to a denial of service (application crash).
