The root cause of CVE-2018-14498, as earlier described, indeed revolves around the lack of a validity check for color indices that exceed the color map length in an 8-bit BMP file. This oversight leads to an out-of-bounds read vulnerability. Based on the information provided and the nature of the vulnerability, the specific BMP field related to invoking this CVE would be the color index entries as they are being read and applied from the BMP file's color table (also known as a color palette).

In the context of BMP file structure, the `biClrUsed` field of the BMP file header is directly related to this vulnerability. The `biClrUsed` field specifies the number of colors in the color table. When processing an 8-bit BMP file, each pixel value in the image data represents an index into the color table. If the `biClrUsed` value is smaller than expected and the code does not properly check that each color index is within the bounds of this table, it could attempt to read beyond the allocated memory space for the color table, leading to a potential crash due to an out-of-bounds read. 

In the patch provided, a new variable `cmap_length` is introduced and set to the value of `biClrUsed` during the reading and initialization phase (`source->cmap_length = (int)biClrUsed;`). Then, while processing each row of pixels, for every pixel, it checks whether its color index (the value of `t` in the `get_8bit_row` function) exceeds the number of entries in the color table (`cmaplen`) before attempting to access the color table (colormap). If the index is out of bounds (`t >= cmaplen`), it triggers an error (`ERREXIT(cinfo, JERR_BMP_OUTOFRANGE);`), thus preventing the out-of-bounds read. 

This check ensures that the processing abides by the actual length of the color table as defined by the BMP file, effectively mitigating the vulnerability.
