The CVE-2018-13785 vulnerability in libpng is related to the processing of certain fields in a PNG file that are involved in calculating the `row_factor` during the `png_check_chunk_length` function execution. The fields from a PNG file that directly influence the calculation of `row_factor`, and thus are related to invoking this CVE, include:

1. **Width**: Represents the width of the PNG image. It's directly used in the calculation of `row_factor` by multiplying it with the number of channels and bit depth (adjusted for over 8 bits). A very large width can contribute to overflowing the calculation.

2. **Channels**: This relates to the color type of the image (e.g., grayscale, RGB, palette-based, etc.) and determines the number of color channels per pixel. This value directly affects the computation of `row_factor`.

3. **Bit Depth**: Represents the number of bits per channel. In the calculation of `row_factor`, there's a distinction made based on whether the bit depth is greater than 8, affecting the multiplier in the calculation. 

4. **Interlaced**: Indicates whether the PNG image uses Adam7 interlacing. This affects the `row_factor` calculation by conditionally adding a value to it (to account for the interlacing processing overhead).

The width, channels, and bit depth are parameters intrinsic to the PNG format's IHDR (Image Header) chunk, specifying the image's general attributes. The `interlaced` status is also specified in the IHDR chunk. A specially crafted PNG file with exaggerated values for these fields, specifically a very large width or an inappropriate combination of width, bit depth, and channels, can trigger the integer overflow and the subsequent divide-by-zero error addressed by this CVE.

Therefore, the IHDR chunk, which contains these critical fields (width, height, bit depth, color type [affecting channels], and interlace method), plays a pivotal role in invoking CVE-2018-13785 when processing with a vulnerable version of libpng.
