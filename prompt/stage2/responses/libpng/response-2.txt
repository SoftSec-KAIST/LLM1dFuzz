From the information provided about CVE-2018-13785 and the details of the patch, the vulnerability is triggered during the processing of PNG files, specifically when handling the chunk length in `png_check_chunk_length` function within `pngrutil.c`. The fields from the PNG file format that are directly related to invoking this CVE are:

1. **Width** (`png_ptr->width`): This field specifies the width of the image in pixels. It is used as part of the calculation for `row_factor`, which indicates the bytes required to store a row of the image. A large width value could contribute to the possibility of an integer overflow when multiplied with other factors.

2. **Channels** (`png_ptr->channels`): This indicates the number of color channels in the image. For instance, RGB images have 3 channels, and RGBA images have 4. This value also plays a significant role in the `row_factor` calculation and, thereby, can affect the possibility of an integer overflow when combined with large values of width, bit depth, and other factors.

3. **Bit Depth** (`png_ptr->bit_depth`): The bit depth is the number of bits used to represent each pixel's color information. The affected code checks if the `bit_depth` is greater than 8 (meaning it could be 16 for high color depth images) as part of the calculation for the `row_factor`. This influences the amount of data that needs to be processed per pixel and, when combined with width and the number of channels, it factors into the risk of an integer overflow.

4. **Interlaced** (`png_ptr->interlaced`): This field indicates if the image uses interlacing, a method that can allow an image to be progressively rendered as it is downloaded. The presence of interlacing slightly changes the calculation of `row_factor` by adding a small constant value (6 in the patched calculation) based on whether the image is interlaced, which could marginally influence the risk of overflow in extreme scenarios.

The vulnerability essentially stems from how these fields' values are used in calculations without sufficient consideration for potential integer overflow, which could then lead to a divide-by-zero error, manifesting as a denial of service upon processing a specially crafted PNG file. The patch corrects the calculation of `row_factor` by ensuring safe arithmetic operations that account for large values and prevent overflows.
