The field in SQL related to invoking CVE-2019-19923 involves the use of `SELECT DISTINCT` in combination with a `LEFT JOIN` where the right-hand side of the join is a view. The specific interaction that triggers the vulnerability relates to the optimization process when SQLite attempts to flatten the subquery for execution optimization purposes. 

In general, this means that a SQL query that combines `SELECT DISTINCT` with a `LEFT JOIN` on a view could potentially exploit this vulnerability if run against a vulnerable version of SQLite (prior to the patch being applied). The intent of such a query would be to select distinct values from a set of results produced by joining two tables, where the join condition specifies that all rows from the left table should be returned, even if the join condition does not find any matching rows in the right table (a view in this instance), in which case NULLs would be returned for columns from the right-hand table/view. 

This specific interaction leads to the conditions where the flaw could manifest as incorrect query results due to stale register access or, more severely, a crash due to a NULL-pointer dereference when the query flattening optimization is incorrectly applied by the database engine.
