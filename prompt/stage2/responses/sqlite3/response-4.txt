The field in SQL that relates to invoking CVE-2019-19923 is associated with executing a query that involves `SELECT DISTINCT` combined with a `LEFT JOIN` where the right-hand side of the `LEFT JOIN` is a view. This specific composition of SQL operations and structures triggers the vulnerability.

To potentially exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to craft a SQL query that:

1. Uses `SELECT DISTINCT` to ensure the outer query is attempting to return only distinct results.
2. Incorporates a `LEFT JOIN`, which specifies a join condition and retrieves all records from the left table (the first table mentioned in the query), along with matching records from the right table (the table on the right-hand side of the `JOIN`), or `NULL` in the case of no match.
3. Specifies that the right-hand side of the `LEFT JOIN` operation is a view, not a simple table. A view in SQL is a virtual table based on the result-set of an SQL statement.

An example query that might have been problematic before the patch (not necessarily exploiting the vulnerability for malicious purposes but could illustratively cause the issue) could look something like this:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT main.id 
FROM main
LEFT JOIN (SELECT * FROM view_name) AS subview ON main.id = subview.ref_id;
```

In this hypothetical example, `main` would be your primary table, and `subview` would be the result of a `SELECT` operation on a view named `view_name`, which serves as the right-hand side of the `LEFT JOIN`. This type of query structure, under specific conditions before the patch was applied, could lead to a NULL pointer dereference or incorrect query results due to the optimization flaw addressed by CVE-2019-19923.
