The field in SQL related to invoking CVE-2019-19923 involves the use of `SELECT DISTINCT` in combination with a `LEFT JOIN` where the right-hand side of the `LEFT JOIN` is a view. This specific scenario can trigger the bug due to how the query optimization and flattening processes mishandle the unique structural conditions arising from this particular use case.

To summarize, constructing an SQL query that:
- Utilizes `SELECT DISTINCT` to ensure unique results,
- Involves a `LEFT JOIN` operation,
- And importantly, the right-hand side of the `LEFT JOIN` is defined as a view (a stored query that is treated as a virtual table),

could potentially invoke the vulnerability described in CVE-2019-19923 before the patch was applied. The mishandling of such queries could lead to incorrect results or a NULL pointer dereference within SQLite's internal processing. 

This insight into the interaction between `SELECT DISTINCT` and complex `JOIN` operations, particularly involving views, highlights the intricate nature of SQL query optimization and the challenges in ensuring both efficient and correct query execution across varied and complex query structures.
