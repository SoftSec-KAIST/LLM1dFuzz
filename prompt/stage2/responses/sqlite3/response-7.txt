The specific field in SQL that relates to invoking CVE-2019-19923 is the combination of using `SELECT DISTINCT` in conjunction with a `LEFT JOIN` where the right-hand side of the JOIN is a view. The vulnerability manifests in the optimization engine when it attempts to flatten subqueries under these conditions, leading to possible NULL pointer dereference or incorrect results.

To potentially trigger this vulnerability, an SQL query would need to specifically be structured to use `SELECT DISTINCT` combined with a `LEFT JOIN` in which the joined table on the right is actually a view rather than a direct reference to a database table. The mishandling of such queries by SQLite before the patch could lead to the application crashes or unexpected behavior outlined in the description of CVE-2019-19923.

Here is an illustrative example of the kind of SQL query that might have been problematic before the patch:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT column_name(s)
FROM table_name
LEFT JOIN view_name ON table_name.column_name = view_name.column_name;
```

In this hypothetical query, `table_name` is a normal table, and `view_name` is a view that might involve its own complex query. Prior to the patch, SQLite's attempt to optimize this query by flattening the subquery associated with the view could lead to the incorrect execution dynamics described in the CVE.

It's important to emphasize that this description simplifies a complex interaction within SQLite's query optimization system, highlighting the key elements related to the CVE without diving into all the technical nuances of SQLite's optimization decisions and their implications.
