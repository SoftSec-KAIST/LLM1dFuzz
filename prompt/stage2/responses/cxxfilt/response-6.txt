Based on the details provided earlier regarding the patch notes and the specific nature of CVE-2016-4487 within the libiberty component of GNU Binutils, and given the clarification that the root cause relates to the 'bsize' variable not being correctly initialized when 'btypevec' is freed, we can narrow down the field in mangled names associated with invoking this CVE.

From the patch, one significant part that addresses the underlying issue is:

```c
if (work -> btypevec != NULL)
{
  free ((char *) work -> btypevec);
  work->btypevec = NULL;
  work->bsize = 0;
}
```

This patch indicates that after freeing `btypevec`, it's crucial to reset `bsize` to 0 to avoid misuse of already freed memory. This problem essentially relates to how certain types are demangled. In C++ demangling, the 'btypevec' array is used to keep track of "back references" to previously seen types in a mangled name. This feature allows mangled names to be shorter by referring back to types that have already been mentioned instead of repeating their complete definition.

Given this understanding, the fields in mangled names related to invoking this CVE would involve:

1. **Template Arguments**: The parsing and demangling of template arguments can involve back-references for previously seen types. Incorrect handling here could lead to conditions that manipulate `btypevec` and `bsize` improperly.

2. **Function Parameters and Return Types**: Similar to template arguments, function parameters and return types that use previously defined types could trigger back-referencing.

The precise trigger would depend on the structure of the mangled name that invokes handling where `btypevec` is usedâ€”essentially, any complex type information in the mangled name (like templates or function signatures involving previously defined types) that would engage the back-reference mechanism might be related to exploiting this vulnerability. 

Without a specific mangled name or pattern provided in your question, it's important to note that any use of the demangling feature that led to the incorrect clean-up of `btypevec` without properly resetting `bsize` could potentially exploit CVE-2016-4487.
