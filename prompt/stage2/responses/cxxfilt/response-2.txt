Based on the information provided and focusing on the specific detail that the root cause of CVE-2016-4487 is the uninitialized 'bsize' variable when freeing 'btypevec', we can infer that this vulnerability is related to the handling of C++ demangled names, particularly those that involve template parameters or other complex name constructions that might require dynamic memory allocation and manipulation of type vectors (`btypevec`) in the libiberty's demangling process.

Given the context and specifics of the patch details shared earlier, it's reasonable to assume that handling of complex C++ names, especially those involving templates (which would be denoted in the mangled names by symbols such as "T", indicative of template parameters, or other constructs that involve allocations of type vectors), could trigger this vulnerability. The incorrect memory management (specifically the use-after-free issue connected to the 'bsize' variable associated with 'btypevec') could be invoked when dealing with such complex names during the demangling process.

In C++ demangled names, the use of templates, namespaces, and other complex types necessitates careful handling of memory for storing information about these types. The mangled names that include these elements would be particularly relevant in invoking the CVE because they are likely to engage the code paths that manipulate `btypevec` and rely on `bsize` for proper memory management.

Therefore, any C++ mangled name that leads to the allocation and manipulation of `btypevec`—particularly those involving complex types like templates—could be related to invoking this CVE.
