The vulnerability CVE-2017-9047 in libxml2 is related to the handling of the XML element content definitions. Specifically, it deals with how libxml2 processes XML element content names (`content->name`) and prefixes (`content->prefix`) in the context of building or parsing an XML document's structure, particularly when it comes to formatting the element content for output.

The fields in XML that directly relate to invoking this CVE would be:

1. **Element Names (`content->name`):** The names of the XML elements are directly involved in this vulnerability. If an XML document contains elements with names that, when processed in conjunction with their prefixes, exceed the allocated buffer size in certain contexts, it could trigger the overflow.

2. **Namespace Prefixes (`content->prefix`):** XML namespaces are a way to ensure element name uniqueness. They are represented as prefixes in XML tags. The misuse or abuse of namespace prefixes, especially long or maliciously crafted ones, combined with element names, can contribute to triggering the buffer overflow described by the CVE. This is because the function attempts to concatenate the namespace prefix and the element name into a single buffer without sufficiently checking if there is enough space left in the buffer.

An XML document exploiting this vulnerability might have excessively long names for either the elements or the prefixes, or a combination of both, aiming to exceed the buffer limit when the document is processed by an application using an unpatched version of libxml2's `xmlSnprintfElementContent` function.

To clarify, although the vulnerability is triggered during the processing (especially when trying to format the output) of these XML fields (`element names` and `namespace prefixes`), the actual malicious input would come from the XML document being processed - particularly in how the element names and/or prefixes are defined within that document.
