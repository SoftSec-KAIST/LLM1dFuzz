Based on the information provided in the previous discussion regarding CVE-2017-9047, the vulnerability is triggered during the process of recursively dumping the element content definition into a character buffer. Specifically, the issue occurs in the context of processing XML element content definitions.

The fields in an XML document that are directly related to invoking this CVE would be the element names and prefixes, as the vulnerability is related to how the libxml2 library's `xmlSnprintfElementContent` function handles the concatenation of these XML element details (names and optional prefixes) into a buffer.

When the function attempts to append the `content->prefix` (if it exists) and the `content->name` to the buffer, the flawed logic and incorrect buffer size checks lead to a buffer overflow if the available buffer size is not properly validated after each concatenation operation. Hence, XML documents with specifically crafted element names and prefixes that exploit the insufficient buffer size checks in the `xmlSnprintfElementContent` function could trigger the vulnerability.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker could craft an XML document with element names and prefixes designed in such a way that when processed by an application using the affected version of libxml2, it would result in a buffer overflow, potentially leading to a crash or arbitrary code execution.

In summary, the `element names` and `prefixes` in an XML document are the fields related to invoking CVE-2017-9047, as manipulation of these fields can trigger the buffer overflow condition in libxml2's handling of element content definitions.
