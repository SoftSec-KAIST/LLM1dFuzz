The vulnerability described in CVE-2017-9047 involves the way libxml2 handles XML elements, specifically when dumping the element content definition into a buffer using the `xmlSnprintfElementContent` function in `valid.c`. The fields in XML that are directly related to invoking this CVE are the element names and prefixes, as these are the strings being concatenated into the buffer `buf`.

When an XML document is being processed:

1. **Element Names**: These are directly used and appended to the buffer. If an element name is excessively long or if there are a large number of nested elements, it could contribute to the buffer overflow condition by causing more data to be written to the buffer than it can hold.

2. **Prefixes**: Similarly, element prefixes (used to denote namespaces in XML) are also appended to the buffer. A prefix is concatenated along with the colon character `":"` and the element name. Prefixes, like element names, contribute to the total length of the string being added to the buffer.

The vulnerability specifically manifests when these strings are concatenated to the buffer without adequately checking that the buffer has enough space left to accommodate them. The root cause is not correctly updating the length of the buffer (`len`) after each addition, and using this stale length information for subsequent space checks. Therefore, the fields related to invoking this CVE would be those parts of an XML document that define element names and prefixes, particularly in complex XML documents with deep nesting or long names that might exacerbate the buffer management issue.
