The CVE-2017-9047 vulnerability in libxml2 specifically relates to the handling of XML element content definitions, with a focus on the handling of `content->prefix` and `content->name` fields within an XML document.

In libxml2, the function `xmlSnprintfElementContent` is responsible for dumping the structure of an XML element's content definition into a character buffer (`buf`). The issue arises when this function attempts to append the `content->prefix` and `content->name` fields of an XML element content to this buffer without adequately checking if there's enough space left in the buffer for these fields.

So, to directly answer the question, the fields related to invoking this CVE are:

- **`content->prefix`**: This field refers to the namespace prefix of an XML element. In XML, the namespace is a way to avoid name collisions by qualifying names with a namespace prefix. For instance, in `<prefix:elementName>`, `prefix` is the namespace prefix.
- **`content->name`**: This field contains the name of the XML element itself.

The vulnerability takes place when the concatenation of an element's prefix and name, along with potentially other characters (like the namespace separator ":", and possibly additional fixed strings added by `xmlSnprintfElementContent`), exceed the allocated size of the `buf` character buffer. The original code did not adequately check available buffer space after each operation, allowing for a scenario where more data could be written to `buf` than it could hold, leading to a buffer overflow situation. This kind of overflow can cause crashes or potentially allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code, depending on the context in which the vulnerable version of libxml2 is used.
