Based on the information regarding CVE-2017-9047 and the details provided about the vulnerability and its patch, the field in XML that is directly related to invoking this CVE is related to the element content definitions, particularly the naming and prefixing of XML elements.

The vulnerability arises in the function `xmlSnprintfElementContent` in the file `valid.c` within the libxml2 library. This function is involved in recursively dumping an XML element's content definition into a character buffer. The critical aspect of this process, which ties to the CVE, involves handling XML elementsâ€™ names (`content->name`) and their prefixes (`content->prefix`). Specifically, when the XML content being processed includes elements with names (and optionally prefixes), the improper buffer size checks and failure to account for the additional space needed for these strings can lead to a buffer overflow.

For example, an XML document structured with deeply nested elements or elements with long names and prefixes could trigger this vulnerability if the processing involves serializing or otherwise manipulating the elements' content definitions in a manner that invokes the flawed `xmlSnprintfElementContent` function. Such manipulations are common in applications that parse, validate, or transform XML content based on its schema or DTD (Document Type Definition).

Given this context, the specific field in XML related to invoking CVE-2017-9047 would be the "Element Names and Prefixes" used within the XML document being processed. This is because the vulnerability is triggered by how these specific parts of the XML content are handled (or mismanaged) in the context of buffer size calculations during the serialization or processing of the XML element content definitions.
