The CVE-2017-9047 vulnerability is related specifically to XML element content definitions. In the context of XML and the libxml2 library, the function `xmlSnprintfElementContent` that is affected by this CVE is responsible for dumping the content definition of XML elements into a character buffer. 

The fields within XML that invoke this CVE would involve:

1. **Element Names (`content->name`)**: The content definition that includes the name of the XML element(s). The vulnerability is triggered when the process attempts to append the element's name to the buffer without properly verifying that there is enough space left, leading to a potential buffer overflow.

2. **Namespace Prefixes (`content->prefix`)**: The namespace prefix associated with the element. The incorrect handling and insufficient buffer size check upon appending the prefix (and possibly the colon ":" separator) before the element's name can also trigger this vulnerability. 

The structure of an XML document that could potentially exploit this vulnerability would include deeply nested elements or elements with long names and/or prefixes, especially when these XML document structures are processed by applications using the vulnerable versions of libxml2.

Given this, an XML-based attack exploiting CVE-2017-9047 would likely involve crafting an XML document with carefully structured elements designed to exceed the buffer capacity during processing, leveraging the flawed buffer size checks in `xmlSnprintfElementContent`. 

For example, an attacker could construct an XML element with a long name or deeply nest elements to exploit the insufficient check for the available buffer size and potentially cause a buffer overflow, leading to a crash or other unintended behavior in applications using the affected libxml2 version.
