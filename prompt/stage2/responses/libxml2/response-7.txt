The vulnerability CVE-2017-9047 in libxml2 is invoked during the processing of XML content definitions, specifically when dealing with element names and prefixes. This would typically be encountered in XML documents that define complex types or structures leveraging XML namespaces. In the context of XML, namespaces are used to disambiguate element or attribute names across different XML documents or schemas. A namespace is often declared using a prefix, which is then prepended to element names to indicate their namespace.

The fields in XML related to invoking CVE-2017-9047 would include:

1. **Element Names (content->name)**: The actual name of the XML element. In an XML document, this would correspond to the tag name used for an element. According to the vulnerability details, an overflow can occur when appending the element name to an internal buffer without properly checking if there's enough space left in the buffer.

2. **Namespace Prefixes (content->prefix)**: An optional field that, when used, specifies the namespace prefix of the element. In XML, namespaces are declared using a `xmlns` attribute, and the prefix provides a shorthand for referencing the namespace within the document. For example, in `<xs:element name="example">`, "xs" would be the namespace prefix.

An example XML snippet that could potentially interact with these fields (simplified for clarity and not necessarily causing the issue directly) might look like this:

```xml
<xs:schema xmlns:xs="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema">
    <xs:element name="example" type="xs:string"/>
</xs:schema>
```

In this snippet:

- `"xs"` serves as a namespace prefix (related to `content->prefix` in the context of the vulnerability), and
- `"example"` is an element name (related to `content->name`).

During the processing of such XML content, if the libxml2 library's function `xmlSnprintfElementContent` was used to handle this structure before the patch was applied, and the combination of prefix, element name, and surrounding syntax exceeded the allocated buffer size without proper length checks, it could lead to a buffer overflow, effectively exploiting CVE-2017-9047.

This vulnerability is specifically related to how libxml2 validates and processes the Document Type Definition (DTD) or XML schema contents, rather than the handling of simple data content within XML documents.

It's important to note that exploitation of this vulnerability would likely require crafted or malicious XML content designed to trigger the buffer overflow condition through excessive or specifically structured element names and namespace prefixes.
