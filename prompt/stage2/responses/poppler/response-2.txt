Given your clarification, it's apparent that I focused too much on the specific technical details provided in the initial explanation and patch. In light of your correction, let's revisit the issue with a clearer understanding of the root cause being the lack of sanity checks on negative object numbers of indirect objects within a PDF.

In the context of this specific vulnerability (CVE-2019-7310) in Poppler and the clarification you've provided:

**The Root Cause**: The root cause is indeed the handling, or rather the mishandling, of negative object numbers of indirect objects. PDF files consist of objects that can reference other objects in the file. These references are supposed to be non-negative as per the PDF specification, which outlines indirect objects and their referencing mechanisms.

**Related PDF Field**: The field in a PDF file that would be related to invoking this CVE is the object number associated with indirect objects. When a PDF document is parsed, each object is supposed to have a positive object number, indicating its position or existence within the document's table of contents. If a PDF is crafted maliciously with an indirect object having a negative object number and is then processed by a vulnerable version of Poppler, it can lead to an attempt to access an incorrect memory location, due to the signedness error, causing a heap-based buffer over-read. This scenario can result in a denial of service (application crash) or potentially other unspecified impacts.

The integer signedness error mentioned in the context of `XRef::getEntry` and the subsequent patch prevents the application from processing these malformed references by adding a check for negative indices, which correspond to the indirect object numbers in the broader sense of PDF structure handling.

Hence, in more direct answer to your question, the "indirect object number" field, specifically when manipulated to be negative in a malformed PDF, would be related to the exploitation of this vulnerability. This field is part of the internal structure of a PDF document, where each object is identified by a unique object number (and a generation number, though it is the object number that is of concern here regarding CVE-2019-7310).
