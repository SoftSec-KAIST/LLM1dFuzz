Based on the correction provided and diving back into the prior explanation, the vulnerability (CVE-2019-7310) involves a signedness issue within the `XRef::getEntry` function that processes indices from a PDF document's xref table without proper validation for negative values. Given this context, and taking into account the functionality exploited by the vulnerability, the related field in a PDF document that could invoke this CVE is most likely associated with the indirect object references.

In a PDF file, objects can be referenced indirectly, and these indirect references are comprised of an object number, a generation number, and the 'R' keyword. They are used throughout PDF files for various purposes, including but not limited to, referencing the content of pages, outlines, annotations, and graphical content. The xref table (cross-reference table) keeps track of the byte offsets of each object within the file, facilitating random access to objects in the PDF.

The vulnerability specifically involves the handling of these object numbers. If a crafted PDF file includes a negative object number for an indirect object, and this number is passed to `XRef::getEntry` without a sanity check, it leads to an integer signedness error, potentially causing a heap-based buffer over-read. As described, this vulnerability could cause a Denial of Service (application crash) or other unspecified impacts when the application tries to access a supposed object location based on the incorrect, negative index.

Thus, when discussing the specific field in PDFs related to invoking this CVE, it would be the entries in the xref table related to object numbers of indirect objects. The improper handling of these object numbers, especially the parsing and use of negative object numbers without adequate validation, is the direct cause of the vulnerability.
