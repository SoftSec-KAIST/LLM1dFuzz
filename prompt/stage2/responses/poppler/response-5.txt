Based on the detailed correction indicating the root cause relates to the parsing and use of negative object numbers of indirect objects without a sanity check, and considering the nature of the CVE and the specific function involved (`XRef::getEntry` in `XRef.cc`), the field in a PDF document most directly related to invoking this CVE would be the cross-reference table (XRef table) or stream.

In PDFs, indirect objects are referenced through the cross-reference (XRef) table or (in PDF 1.5 and later) the XRef stream. This table or stream maps object numbers to the byte offset of the object within the PDF file. When a PDF is parsed, objects are looked up via their object number through this table/stream. If an attacker crafts a PDF to include a negative object number for an indirect object, and the software does not properly verify the sanity of these numbers (i.e., ensuring they are non-negative), it could lead to the heap-based buffer over-read described in CVE-2019-7310 when the software tries to access the reference data.

Given the context, the incorrect handling of negative indices in the cross-reference mechanism directly impacts the parsing process, where the software fails to reject these malformed or malicious entries properly. This could be exploited using specifically crafted PDF files that manipulate the references to indirect objects through the XRef table/stream, leading to the aforementioned vulnerabilities.
