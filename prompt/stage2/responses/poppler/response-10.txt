Given your clarification, the root cause of CVE-2019-7310 indeed points towards the handling of negative object numbers of indirect objects in a PDF document without proper sanity checks. In the context of PDF files and the provided patch details, the relevant field related to invoking this CVE would be the indirect object references within the PDF document structure.

A PDF file consists of several objects, including indirect objects, which are identified by an object number and a generation number, followed by the obj keyword. These objects can be referenced elsewhere in the PDF document using their object and generation numbers. An indirect object might look like this:

```
10 0 obj
  << /Type /Example >>
endobj
```

This indicates an indirect object with an object number of 10 and a generation number of 0. Other parts of the PDF file can reference this object using its object number and generation number.

The vulnerability, as clarified, involves the parsing and use of negative object numbers for these indirect objects without performing checks on the validity of such numbers. This implies that if a crafted PDF document contains a reference to an indirect object with a negative object number, it would trigger the vulnerability because the original code did not anticipate or correctly handle such negative numbers.

Upon parsing such a document, the affected function in `XRef.cc` (`XRef::getEntry`), which is responsible for resolving cross-references to indirect objects, would incorrectly process the negative object number due to the lack of a sanity check for negative values. This could lead to a heap-based buffer over-read, causing a denial of service (application crash) or potentially leading to other unspecified impacts.

The patch mentioned addresses this issue by introducing a check for negative indices early in the `XRef::getEntry` function. This ensures that cases with invalid negative object numbers are properly handled, preventing the exploitation of the vulnerability described in CVE-2019-7310.
