Given the clarification on the root cause for CVE-2019-7310 being related to the negative object number of an indirect object being parsed and used without a sanity check in a PDF file, we can infer that this vulnerability is directly tied to the handling of PDF's "cross-reference table" or "XRef table".

In PDF documents, the cross-reference (XRef) table is utilized to index the indirect objects within the file, providing a way to quickly locate and access these objects. Indirect objects in PDFs are identified by an object number and a generation number, which together create a unique identifier for each object. The XRef table or stream keeps track of the byte offset of each indirect object within the file, making it possible for PDF parsers like Poppler to efficiently find and manipulate these objects.

The issue described in CVE-2019-7310 suggests that when Poppler encounters a PDF with an indirect object that has a negative object number, it incorrectly parses and uses this number without proper validation (sanity check). This leads to a heap-based buffer over-read because the application did not anticipate, and hence did not correctly handle, negative values in this context. The use of negative numbers for object indices, where only positive numbers are valid according to the PDF specification, can therefore trigger unexpected and potentially harmful behavior when manipulated by a PDF processing tool like Poppler.

This vulnerability is exploited through the crafted manipulation of the XRef table/stream in a malicious PDF document, particularly through the crafted use of negative object numbers for indirect objects, which the software fails to properly validate before use.
