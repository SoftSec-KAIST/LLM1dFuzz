The field in Lua related to invoking CVE-2020-24370 is debugging, specifically within the functions `getlocal` and `setlocal`, which are utilized for debugging purposes. These functions are involved in accessing and modifying local variables within Lua scripts. The issue arises in the way these functions handle large or negative integers, leading to a negation overflow and subsequently a segmentation fault when dealing with variable argument lists (varargs) in Lua 5.4.0. The vulnerability is directly related to the debugging aspect of Lua programming, impacting the stability and security of applications that rely on Lua's debugging facilities for handling local variables and their values during runtime debugging sessions.
