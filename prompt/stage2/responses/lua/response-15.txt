The field in Lua related to invoking CVE-2020-24370 is associated with the handling of local variables and vararg (variable arguments) functions, specifically within the functionality provided by the `getlocal` and `setlocal` API functions. This vulnerability is linked to the internal handling of these cases within the `ldebug.c` source file, which is responsible for debugging support functions, including accessing local variables and variable arguments by their indices.

The vulnerability arises when these functions improperly handle negative indices due to an integer negation overflow, which can lead to a segmentation fault. This issue primarily impacts the way Lua's virtual machine accesses local function variables and vararg parameters, making the debugging and manipulation of these values susceptible to a crash if exploited.

Therefore, the field directly related to this CVE involves Lua's mechanisms for debugging and accessing function scope variablesâ€”both local variables defined within functions and the additional arguments passed to variadic functions (those that can accept a variable number of arguments). The patch provided corrects how these indices are handled, ensuring that even with extremely large negative numbers, the integrity of memory access and application stability is preserved.
