The field in Lua related to invoking CVE-2020-24370 is the handling of local variables and vararg (variable number of arguments) functions within the debug functionality, specifically within the functions `getlocal` and `setlocal`. This vulnerability is triggered through the debug interface's ability to access local variables and vararg parameters.

Lua's debug library provides several functions to inspect the call stack of a Lua program and the variables active in each call frame. `getlocal` and `setlocal` are part of this functionality, allowing scripts to get or set the value of a local variable in a specific function on the call stack. The issue arises in how these functions, internally using the debug interface, handled the indexing of local variables and parameters, especially with large negative numbers that led to an integer negation overflow. This incorrect handling could, as demonstrated, cause a segmentation fault when trying to access local variables with a very large index, effectively crashing the Lua interpreter.

The corrected patch shows modifications in `ldebug.c`, specifically in functions related to accessing these local variables and varargs, ensuring that large, unexpected negative indexes are handled gracefully and do not lead to an overflow and subsequent crash. This ties the vulnerability directly to the debug functionality's interaction with local variable and argument management within Lua scripts.
