The CVE-2020-24370 vulnerability is related to the functionality involved in obtaining and setting local variables in Lua scripts, as specifically indicated by the involvement of the `getlocal` and `setlocal` functions. These functions are part of Lua's debug functionalities, which allow for introspection and manipulation of Lua stack frames for purposes such as debugging or dynamic code analysis.

From the provided patch information, it's clear that the vulnerable code resides in the "ldebug.c" file of the Lua source code, which is responsible for debug functionalities. The `getlocal` and `setlocal` functions allow users to get and set the values of local variables in a given stack frame based on their indices. The vulnerability was specifically triggered by passing a large negative number as the index to these functions, leading to a negation overflow and, potentially, a segmentation fault due to out-of-bound memory access.

Therefore, the field in Lua that is related to invoking this CVE is the Debug API, particularly the parts of it that deal with local variable access in Lua scripts. This includes any functionality that leverages or interacts with the `getlocal` and `setlocal` functions through the debug interface, especially where user-input or dynamic values can be passed as arguments to these functions.
