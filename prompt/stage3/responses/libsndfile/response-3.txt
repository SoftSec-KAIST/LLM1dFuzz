To craft a WAV file input that could potentially exploit CVE-2018-19758, we need to manipulate the `cSampleLoops` field in the Sample Chunk ('smpl') to trigger the vulnerability based on the missing sanity check for excessively large `psf->instrument->loop_count`. However, the provided minimal WAV file snippet doesn't currently include an 'smpl' chunk, which is essential for demonstrating this vulnerability. We'll have to add an 'smpl' chunk and specifically set the `cSampleLoops` field to a large value.

The hexadecimal representation of a WAV file starts with the "RIFF" header, followed by the size of the entire file, the "WAVE" identifier, and then one or more chunks such as the "fmt " chunk (describing the format) and the "data" chunk (containing the audio data). 

To introduce the 'smpl' chunk that is relevant for invoking this CVE, we would follow these steps, keeping the structure coherent with WAV file specifications:

1. Following the minimal WAV file structure provided, we append the 'smpl' chunk after the 'data' chunk.
2. The 'smpl' chunk starts with the 'smpl' identifier ("736D706C" in hexadecimal).
3. Next, we define the chunk size, which needs to accommodate the fields we're setting, including the `cSampleLoops` field.
4. Then, we need to set a high value for `cSampleLoops` to exploit the vulnerability related to excessive loop count.

Here's a basic structure of how we could append an 'smpl' chunk for demonstration purposes, with a hypothetical high value for `cSampleLoops` (Note: this is a simplified example, actual exploitation might require precision in the crafted values depending on the vulnerability's specifics and how the application processes this crafted file):
```
5249 4646 2d00 0000 5741 5645 666d 7420
1000 0000 0100 0100 401f 0000 401f 0000
0100 0800 6461 7461 0100 0000 7f
736D706C 2800 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000
0100 0000 FFFF FFFF 0000 0000 0000 0000
```
This sequence adds an 'smpl' chunk after your provided minimal WAV data. However, to effectively introduce a vulnerability exploiting element:

- `"736D706C"` is the ASCII representation for `"smpl"`, indicating the start of the Sample Chunk.
- We then must decide on an `smpl` chunk size (`2800 0000` here is purely illustrative; the actual size should correspond to the chunk content size, including all `smpl` header and loop point data).
- Setting the field for number of sample loops (`cSampleLoops`) to a high value (like `FFFFFFFF` to maximize it in this simplified context, though this specific value is illustratively exaggerative).

However, remember this crafted value and approach are hypothetical and simplified. A real exploitation attempt would need to adhere to the precise format specifications and consider how libsndfile processes the 'smpl' chunk, especially with respect to `cSampleLoops`.

Given the constraints of our discussion and the theoretical nature of this exercise, this approach is for educational purposes only, aiming to understand how data structures and lack of proper validation can introduce vulnerabilities in software systems.
