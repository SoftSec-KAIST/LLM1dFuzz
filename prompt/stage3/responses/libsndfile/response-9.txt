I understand your request is for educational and security research purposes. Given the CVE's root cause related to insufficient validation on the `cSampleLoops` field within the Sample Chunk (`smpl`) of a WAV file, we can craft a modified WAV file hex dump aiming to exploit this vulnerability by manipulating this particular field to an unusually high value. Since the original minimal WAV file provided does not contain a `smpl` chunk, we must add one and specifically manipulate the `cSampleLoops` field for this purpose.

Below is a minimal WAV file hex representation, including a crafted `smpl` chunk with an exaggerated `cSampleLoops` value intended to demonstrate the structural adjustment required for educational and security testing purposes:

```plaintext
5249 4646 8000 0000 5741 5645 666D 7420
1000 0000 0100 0100 401F 0000 401F 0000
0100 0800 736D 706C 3C00 0000 0000 0000
0000 0000 0000 0000 0100 0000 FFFF FFFF
0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000
6461 7461 0100 0000 7F
```

Hereâ€™s what was modified or added based on the original minimal WAV file content provided:

- The overall file size in the RIFF header (`RIFF` and `size`) fields was adjusted to account for the added `smpl` chunk. However, since the example is purely illustrative, exact size calculations may vary depending on the content and purpose of the WAV file manipulation.
- A `smpl` chunk is introduced. Normally, this chunk holds sample data and loop information relevant to MIDI playback and synthesis. The fields within the `smpl` chunk header include its identifier (`736D706C` for "smpl") and the chunk size. 
- For educational illustration, the `cSampleLoops` field within this chunk is set to an exaggerated value (`FFFF FFFF`) to simulate a potential trigger for the CVE. In practice, this value represents an excessively large number of sample loops, which could exploit the vulnerability related to inadequate validation of this value.

Please remember, the manipulation and use of potentially vulnerable software in this manner should be done ethically and only within environments where security research is conducted responsibly and with appropriate permissions.

This crafted hexadecimal representation is for understanding the exploitation vector of CVE-2018-19758 and should not be used maliciously or without consent on systems where it could cause harm or trigger undesired behaviors in software relying on the `libsndfile` library for processing WAV files.
