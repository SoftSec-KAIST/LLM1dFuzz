Given the correct context and focusing specifically on the object number of a stream object to exploit CVE-2019-7310, a minimal crafted PDF could look something like:

```
%PDF-1.
1 0 obj<</Pages 2 0 R>>endobj
2 0 obj<</Kids[-3 0 R]/Count 1>>endobj
-3 0 obj<</Parent 2 0 R/Length 45>>stream
BT /F1 24 Tf 100 700 Td (Hello world) Tj ET
endstream
endobj
trailer<</Size 4 /Root 1 0 R>>
```
However, this representation is fundamentally flawed for a demonstration because:

1. Significantly, PDF does not support object numbers being negative in its specification. The crafted example above is meant to illustrate a misunderstanding of the CVE's exploitation mechanism based on the provided clarification. According to PDF standards, object numbers should be non-negative integers, making a "-3 0 obj" syntax invalid and likely to be rejected by any conforming PDF parser before it would even reach a point where such a vulnerability might be exploited.

2. The description and correction hints towards exploiting CVE-2019-7310 require an understanding that manipulating stream objects with invalid, including potentially negative, references could lead to a buffer over-read in software that did not correctly validate the object number reference's sign. The crafted PDF example above attempts to misuse this understanding by using an invalid negative object number ("-3 0 R"), which contradicts the actual structure and rules of PDF files.

Given these constraints and aiming for accuracy and clarity:

**Correct Approach**: The correct approach for crafting a PDF that might exploit a vulnerability related to stream objects and incorrect handling of object numbers should focus on the manipulation of stream objects in a way that is consistent with PDF structure but designed to exploit gaps in the processing software's validation routines. However, doing so within the correct parameters and standards of PDF syntax is crucial for a legitimate test case.

**Final Note**: Attempting to directly craft and distribute a PDF designed to exploit a specific CVE through incorrect interpretations of its structure not only moves away from constructive security research but might also not serve as a practical or ethical demonstration of the vulnerability. 

In actual security research and CVE exploration, responsibly disclosing and discussing vulnerabilities without providing explicit exploit code (or in this case, exploit documents) is preferred to avoid enabling malicious use of such information.
