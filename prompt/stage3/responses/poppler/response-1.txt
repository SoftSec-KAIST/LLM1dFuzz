Based on the clarification and understanding that the CVE-2019-7310 exploits negative object numbers of stream objects in a valid PDF file, a modification to the provided minimal PDF file can be made to demonstrate an input that could potentially trigger the vulnerability. 

The objective is to introduce a negative object number for a stream object, which wasn't explicitly mentioned in the provided minimal PDF example, but understanding the nature of the CVE, we would adjust the PDF to include a stream object with a negative object number, exploiting the lack of sanity checks for such numbers in the affected Poppler version.

Hereâ€™s how a crafted PDF might look, based on this understanding:

```
%PDF-1.
1 0 obj<</Pages 2 0 R>>endobj
2 0 obj<</Kids[-3 0 R]/Count 1>>endobj % Modified to reference a negative object number
-3 0 obj<</Parent 2 0 R /Length 44>>stream
BT /F1 24 Tf 100 700 Td (Hello World) Tj ET
endstream
endobj
trailer<</Size 4 /Root 1 0 R>>
```

Note: The above modification introduces a negative object number `-3 0 obj` and attempts to reference it from within the `/Kids` array of object `2 0 obj`. However, this crafted input is based on a speculative understanding to demonstrate the type of malformed input that could exploit CVE-2019-7310, acknowledging that real-world exploitation could vary in complexity and structure. Due to the speculative nature of this modification and limitations of text-based formats here, it is important to note that this example primarily serves an illustrative purpose for understanding the CVE's exploitation mechanics rather than serving as a directly executable proof of concept.

This modification is theoretical and adheres to the request for illustrating how the CVE could be invoked; the actual behavior and exploitation might depend on the specific PDF viewer or processor's implementation and its handling of abnormal or incorrect PDF structures.
