Based on your guidelines and the root cause of CVE-2019-7310, to craft a PDF file that exploits the vulnerability, we'd want to include a negative object number for a stream object, which would typically cause an issue when the parser tries to access this entry without proper validation for negative numbers.

Given the minimal structure of the PDF you provided, we cannot directly include a "stream object" because your example doesn't include one. However, let's craft the scenario closest to exploiting this CVE by incorporating an object number in a way that would cause an issue if negative indices were not checked properly.

Since the vulnerability is in how object numbers might be handled, and especially with stream objects (though not represented in your minimal structure), weâ€™d theoretically introduce a reference to an object with a negative number to showcase where the flaw would be. In real application, the crafted PDF would try to exploit the lack of validation for negative object numbers.

**Note**: The following is a conceptual modification for educational purposes and understanding of the CVE. Actual exploitation would depend on the application parsing the PDF and its handling of object references.

```
%PDF-1.
1 0 obj<</Pages 2 0 R>>endobj
2 0 obj<</Kids[-3 0 R]/Count 1>>endobj % Modified to include a negative object number
3 0 obj<</Parent 2 0 R>>endobj
trailer<</Size 4 /Root 1 0 R>>
```

In this hypothetical alteration, the `/Kids` array in object 2 now includes a reference to `[-3 0 R]`, suggesting a reference to an object with a negative number. Since PDF does not support negative object numbers per its specification, this introduces an anomaly for demonstration.

**Real Exploitation Scenario**: For an actual crafted PDF intended to exploit CVE-2019-7310, an attacker would need to include in the PDF a stream object (or possibly another type of object that gets processed similarly) with a negative object number, and then have the processing application try to access this object. The exploit would target the specific flaw in the `XRef::getEntry` method of Poppler 0.73.0, where the application would fail to properly validate the signedness of the object number, potentially leading to a heap-based buffer over-read.
