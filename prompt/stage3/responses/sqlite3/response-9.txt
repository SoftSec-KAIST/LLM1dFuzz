Based on the information provided about CVE-2019-19923, a SQL query that might demonstrate an input triggering the vulnerability before it was patched would need to feature `SELECT DISTINCT` combined with a `LEFT JOIN` where the right-hand side is a view. However, creating a precise SQL statement to exploit the vulnerability would depend on the specific database schema, including views and how they're defined.

Given the minimal structure you've provided and without direct access to a specific database schema to reference, I can only give a hypothetical example. Please note, using or testing such queries on systems without explicit permission is against many ethical guidelines and likely illegal. This example is purely for educational purposes to illustrate how such a vulnerability might be theoretically triggered.

```sql
CREATE VIEW example_view AS SELECT * FROM some_other_table;

SELECT DISTINCT main_table.some_column
FROM main_table
LEFT JOIN example_view 
ON main_table.id = example_view.id;
```

In this hypothetical SQL:

- `some_other_table` is assumed to be another table in your database.
- `example_view` is a view created for the purpose of this example and would be the right-hand side of the `LEFT JOIN`.
- `main_table` represents a table in your database with at least one column (`some_column`) and an `id` column to join on.
- The `SELECT DISTINCT main_table.some_column` combined with `LEFT JOIN example_view` on a certain condition (`main_table.id = example_view.id`) could trigger the vulnerability if `example_view` and `main_table` meet the conditions triggering the bug, and if SQLite is not updated to a version where the fix for CVE-2019-19923 is applied.

Remember, this is a constructed example and may need adjustments to work in a real-life scenario, including fitting the schema of an actual SQLite database exhibiting the vulnerable behavior outlined in CVE-2019-19923. Always perform such security research within the bounds of the law and ethical guidelines, such as in a controlled environment with permission or on systems intended for security testing and research.
