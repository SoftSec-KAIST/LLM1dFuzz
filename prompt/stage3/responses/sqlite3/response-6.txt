Based on the root cause and related field of CVE-2019-19923, to potentially trigger the vulnerability, one would need to construct an SQL statement that uses `SELECT DISTINCT` combined with a `LEFT JOIN` where the right-hand side of the join is a view. Considering the constraints of SQLite and keeping the effectiveness of the CVE in mind, please note that the below SQL code is purely hypothetical for the purposes of understanding the vulnerability contextually. This kind of SQL could theoretically trigger the vulnerability if the SQLite version is unpatched against CVE-2019-19923. Please ensure that this is used responsibly and ethically within a controlled environment for security research or educational purposes only.

```sql
-- Assuming 'myTable' and 'myView' exist within your SQLite database

CREATE VIEW myView AS SELECT column1 FROM myTable;

SELECT DISTINCT a.*
FROM myTable AS a
LEFT JOIN myView AS b ON a.id = b.column1;
```

In this hypothetical SQL, `myTable` and `myView` are placeholders for an actual table and view within your SQLite database. `myTable` needs to have at least a column named `id` and `column1`, where `column1` is used in creating `myView`. This SQL statement attempts to make a `SELECT DISTINCT` query on `myTable` a, performing a `LEFT JOIN` on the view `myView` b. According to the CVE-2019-19923 description, such a query could trigger the vulnerability by mishandling the query optimization, either leading to incorrect results due to stale data access or a NULL pointer dereference resulting in a crash.

Please modify the table and column names as needed to fit the actual schema of your test database and ensure that the SQLite version in use is appropriate for such a security test (ideally in a sandboxed or isolated environment).
