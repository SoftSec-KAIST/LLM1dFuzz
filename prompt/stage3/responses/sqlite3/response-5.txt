Given the constraints and ethical considerations of directly exploiting CVE vulnerabilities in real systems, itâ€™s important to note that this response is hypothetical and aimed at understanding the vulnerability for educational and preventive purposes. Crafting an SQL query that could potentially exploit CVE-2019-19923, based on our previous discussion and within the bounds of SQLite's query capabilities before the patch, would involve using `SELECT DISTINCT` with a `LEFT JOIN` where the right-hand side is a view.

Below is a conceptual example based on the structure we know could trigger the vulnerability. Keep in mind, exploiting this would depend on having the right schema and data in place that fit the conditions SQLite mishandled before the patch was applied.

```sql
CREATE TABLE main_table (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, value TEXT);
CREATE TABLE secondary_table (id INTEGER, linked_value TEXT);
CREATE VIEW sample_view AS SELECT * FROM secondary_table;
INSERT INTO main_table (id, value) VALUES (1, 'test1'), (2, 'test2');
INSERT INTO secondary_table (id, linked_value) VALUES (1, 'linked1'), (2, 'linked2');

SELECT DISTINCT main_table.value
FROM main_table LEFT JOIN sample_view ON main_table.id = sample_view.id;
```

Here's a breakdown of what this SQL is intended to do, in the context of understanding CVE-2019-19923:

- **Create a Primary Table and a Secondary Table**: These are regular tables where one contains primary records, and the other is intended to be associated in some way (e.g., via an ID).
- **Create a View**: `sample_view` is a view based on `secondary_table`. This fits the pattern of a view on the right-hand side of a `LEFT JOIN`.
- **Populate Tables**: Inserts data into both tables to have something meaningful to join on and select.
- **Crafted SELECT Query**: The query uses `SELECT DISTINCT` combined with a `LEFT JOIN` where the right-hand side is the view named `sample_view`. This specific setup, especially before the patch, could lead to exploiting the vulnerability due to how SQLite handled the optimization of such queries.

Remember, the exact impact and ability to trigger the vulnerability would heavily depend on the SQLite version (3.30.1 or before the patch), the specific query planner's decisions, and the existing database schema and data. This example aims to reflect the theoretical understanding of CVE-2019-19923's root cause for educational purposes and should not be used on real or production systems without proper authorization and for legitimate research or testing reasons.
