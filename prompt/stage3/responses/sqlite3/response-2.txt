Given the specifics around CVE-2019-19923 and keeping in mind that creating or using such SQL for malicious purposes is unethical and potentially illegal, I'll outline a hypothetical SQL query that follows the pattern related to the vulnerability. This example is for educational and security research purposes to understand and mitigate such vulnerabilities better. It's crucial to ensure that testing of vulnerabilities is conducted in a controlled, safe, and legal environment, like a test database with permission to perform security analysis.

To potentially trigger the CVE-2019-19923 vulnerability, you would need an SQL environment that matches the version and configuration susceptible to the issue, specifically SQLite 3.30.1 before the patch was applied. Here is an illustrative SQL statement pattern:

```sql
-- Hypothetical example to understand CVE-2019-19923's vulnerable pattern
-- This requires a setup with specific SQLite version (3.30.1) and a database schema that includes a view.

-- Assuming 'myView' is a view already created in the database for demonstration
-- The view could be created as follows for setup (not part of the exploit):
-- CREATE VIEW myView AS SELECT * FROM myTable;

SELECT DISTINCT a.*
FROM 
    (SELECT * FROM myView) a
LEFT JOIN 
    (SELECT * FROM myView) b
ON a.id = b.id;
```

This simplified SQL attempts to mimic the conditions under which CVE-2019-19923 could be triggered, focusing on the `SELECT DISTINCT` combined with a `LEFT JOIN` where the right side is a view. Remember, this example is based on our theoretical understanding of the vulnerability and the information shared in previous responses. The actual behavior and the ability to exploit the vulnerability would depend on several factors including the specific database schema, the presence of required views, and the exact SQLite version.

Always ensure your research and testing activities around vulnerabilities are conducted ethically, legally, and with permission on systems you are authorized to test.
