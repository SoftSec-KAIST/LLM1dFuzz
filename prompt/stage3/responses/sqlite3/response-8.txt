Based on the explanation of CVE-2019-19923's root cause and the associated fields in SQL, modifying the minimal SQL file to potentially trigger the vulnerability involves constructing a query that utilizes `SELECT DISTINCT` combined with a `LEFT JOIN`, where the right-hand side of the join is a view. It's crucial to note that crafting such queries should be done responsibly and only within environments designated for security testing and research. Here's an example that follows these guidelines:

```sql
-- Assuming 'my_table' is an existing table and 'my_view' is a view created based on some conditions.
-- This example is for educational purposes to illustrate the kind of query that could have triggered CVE-2019-19923.

CREATE TABLE my_table(id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, value TEXT);
CREATE VIEW my_view AS SELECT id, value FROM my_table WHERE value IS NOT NULL;

SELECT DISTINCT my_table.id
FROM my_table
LEFT JOIN my_view ON my_table.id = my_view.id;
```

In this crafted SQL:

1. `my_table` is a hypothetical table that would need to exist in your database schema.
2. `my_view` is a view created from `my_table` but filtered by some condition – in this case, where `value` is not NULL.
3. The `SELECT DISTINCT` query then attempts to join `my_table` with `my_view` on their respective `id` fields.

Before the patch for CVE-2019-19923, this pattern of query—specifically, using `SELECT DISTINCT` in combination with a `LEFT JOIN` where the right side is a view—might trigger the vulnerability, leading to a NULL pointer dereference or incorrect results due to mishandling of the query optimization process within SQLite.

Please ensure that any testing or demonstration of vulnerabilities like CVE-2019-19923 is conducted within a controlled environment, and that you have explicit permission to perform security testing on any database systems involved.
