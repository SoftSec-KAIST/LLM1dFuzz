To craft a DER file that could potentially trigger CVE-2017-3735, we'd need to focus on manipulating the `IPAddressFamily` extension, ensuring the scenario where there's an attempt to access address family data with insufficient length, specifically less than two bytes, which could lead to an out-of-bounds read before the patch was applied.

Given we don't have direct visibility into the specific structure of the `IPAddressFamily` extension from the provided hexadecimal string and considering the generic nature of how DER encoding works, I'll outline a theoretical approach to modify such a file to aim at potentially triggering the vulnerability.

The `IPAddressFamily` information would be expected to be part of an extension field, which is not explicitly delineated in the given snippet due to the generic nature of DER encoding. However, to exploit CVE-2017-3735, an attacker would ideally manipulate the part of a DER-encoded certificate that specifies the length of the `addressFamily->data` to be less than what the access operation in `X509v3_addr_get_afi` (before the patch) expects.

A critical aspect to consider is that to accurately perform this manipulation requires detailed knowledge of where the `addressFamily` data lies within the specified DER file, which isn't straightforward from the provided hexadecimal representation without a more detailed map of the structure that specifies where the extension and its various components are located.

However, in a hypothetical modification where one could directly manipulate the `IPAddressFamily` data, you would:
1. Locate the `IPAddressFamily` extension structure (`300a 0608 ...` might look like the start of an extension but without certainty).
2. Ensure that the `addressFamily->data` is present but set the length to indicate 1 byte of data (or none), contrary to the actual required 2 bytes for safe processing.

For example, if `030c` encoded the critical `addressFamily->data` part with supposed adequate length, and you wanted to create a situation reflecting the CVE, you might shorten the length:

**Original (hypothetical structure part)**:
```
... 030c 0161 ...
```

**Modified (assuming `030c` indicates length and `0161` is the data part that's too long):**
```
... 0301 01 ...
```
Where `0301` improperly indicates a length of 1 byte for the following data. This is purely illustrative as `030c` followed by `0161` doesn't correspond to an `IPAddressFamily` structure, but it should give an idea of the manipulation required.

Remember, crafting or distributing malicious inputs for exploiting vulnerabilities is unethical and illegal without proper authorization (e.g., in a controlled, legal cybersecurity test environment).

For genuine security research or penetration testing, ensure you have explicit permission and operate within legal and ethical boundaries.
