To craft an input that could theoretically trigger CVE-2017-3735 based on our understanding, we need to focus on the IPAddressFamily extension within an X.509 certificate and manipulate the length in such a way that it might cause an OpenSSL version vulnerable to CVE-2017-3735 to perform a one-byte overread when parsing the addressFamily data. 

However, before proceeding, it's essential to clarify that without specific details on the structure for encoding an IPAddressFamily extension directly in DER, and given the generic nature of the initial DER file provided, we can hypothesize a general approach to what the modification could look like rather than providing an exact craft.

CVE-2017-3735 involves a one-byte overread in the parsing of an IPAddressFamily extension. This extension is not directly visible in the provided DER hex. To trigger such a vulnerability, a crafted edit would reduce the length of an intended two-bytes or more field to one byte to induce an overread in susceptible OpenSSL versions.

Since the provided hex does not explicitly contain an IPAddressFamily extension part (based on the data provided, and the IPAddressFamily extension OID and context not being pointed out), let's illustrate a generic way one might attempt to modify a hypothetical field for educational purposes. 

To modify an arbitrary field hypothetically related to such an extension with this intent, consider the following segment as an abstract representation of where the extension might be:

```
3008 0603 5504
```

Assuming `3008` indicates the start of a sequence with an intended length, and let's say we want to manipulate what could be the length of the `addressFamily` data (keeping in mind this is purely hypothetical and not directly extracting from the given DER, which doesn't specify such an extension structure):

Original (hex representing an abstract part with adequate length):
```
3008 0603 5504 030c
```

Modified (altering length to potentially induce an overread):
```
3008 0602 5504 03
```

This abstract example reduces a length field, but without an actual identifiable IPAddressFamily extension in the provided hex, this remains a theoretical exercise.

**Attention**: Crafting or modifying input to exploit vulnerabilities for unauthorized testing, unauthorized access, or any illicit activities is illegal and unethical. This response is designed purely for educational purposes to understand CVE-2017-3735 better and should not be used for any unauthorized security testing or malicious activities. Always perform security research within legal and ethical boundaries, such as within environments designed for testing (like CTFs or security labs) or with explicit permission.
