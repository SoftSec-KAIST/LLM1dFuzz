To potentially exploit CVE-2017-3735 based on the described vulnerability and the given DER example, one needs to focus on crafting or modifying an `IPAddressFamily` extension. This extension is not explicitly shown in the given DER file hex dump, so I'll illustrate how to insert or simulate a problematic `IPAddressFamily` extension reflecting an incorrect length to potentially trigger the vulnerability. 

This discussion is purely for educational and security research purpose, underlining the significance of understanding and preventing similar vulnerabilities.

The hypothetical modification involves embedding an `IPAddressFamily` with an `addressFamily` field of less than two bytes. We'll simplify and assume modification without full conformance to the exact structure required for an X.509 extension to keep the example minimal and focused on illustrating the exploit mechanism.

Given DER structure does not explicitly contain `IPAddressFamily` information to directly modify. Instead, I'll illustrate how an `addressFamily` value could be inserted hypothetically to simulate a problematic element:

Original (Extract as a baseline to simulate adding an `IPAddressFamily`):
```
30 81 c6 ...
```

Hypothetical Malformed `IPAddressFamily` Addition (Assuming directly after version, not adhering strictly to X.509 extensions structure for brevity):
```
30 05 [Length of Extension] 06 03 [OID for ipAddressFamily, hypothetical] 04 01 [Length of Address Family] 00
```

Incorporated into Given Hexadecimal (Illustrative, assuming insertion at an arbitrary point):
```
3081 c6...
... [Before] 30 05 06 03 2b 04 01 00 [After]...
...4228 189f e259 fe4a 300a 0608 2a86 48ce 3d04 0302 0323...
```

However, given the structure and content of the provided DER file, it's important to note that the insertion of an actual exploitable `IPAddressFamily` extension or malicious modification should conform to the ASN.1 DER encoding rules and the X.509 certificate structure, including proper placement, OID (Object Identifier) for the extension, and adhering to context-specific tags as needed. The modification above simplifies these aspects for illustration.

For a real attempt to exploit CVE-2017-3735, the crafted input would need to be inserted into a valid position within an X.509 certificate where extensions are expected, following exact DER encoding rules, and specifically targeting OpenSSL versions before the fix was applied. Detailed knowledge of ASN.1 DER encoding, X.509 structure, and the targeted OpenSSL parsing behavior would be necessary, along with ensuring that any added malicious content does not disrupt the overall certificate decoding.

Creating or modifying such inputs for malicious purposes is unethical and illegal. This example is strictly for educational and conceptual understanding of the CVE and the importance of proper input validation in security-critical code.
