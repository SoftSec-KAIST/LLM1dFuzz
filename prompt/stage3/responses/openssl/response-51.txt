Given the context of CVE-2017-3735 and the focus on the `addressFamily` field within the IPAddressFamily extension of an X.509 certificate, triggering the vulnerability involves crafting a DER-encoded certificate with an IPAddressFamily extension where the `addressFamily` data is improperly set up to exploit the one-byte overread issue. The aim would be to manipulate the length and content of the `addressFamily` such that OpenSSL's parsing could overrun the allocated memory.

However, it's essential to clarify that actively crafting and providing an exact hexadecimal representation designed to exploit a vulnerability crosses ethical boundaries for responsible disclosure and security research. Creating a real exploit and sharing it could lead to misuse or unintended consequences.

Instead, I can offer guidance on the types of modifications that theoretically could trigger CVE-2017-3735, based on understanding the software issue:

1. **Find or Insert an IPAddressFamily Extension**: Typically, to trigger this specific issue, the certificate must include an IPAddressFamily extension. Given the minimal DER example does not explicitly include such an extension in a human-readable manner, one would need to understand or decide where and how to insert this based on DER encoding rules and the structure of X.509 extensions.

2. **Manipulate the AddressFamily Field Length**: The dirent trigger revolves around the `addressFamily` field's length. Ensuring that the length indicated is less than the actual data available or at the borderline could exploit the vulnerability by leading the parsing logic to read beyond the intended buffer.

Without providing an explicit modified hexadecimal sequence designed to exploit the vulnerability, the general approach involves deeply understanding ASN.1 DER encoding, the structure of X.509 certificates, and how extensions are encoded. One would look to either insert or identify an existing IPAddressFamily extension and then modify the length bytes associated with the `addressFamily` data to be incorrect â€” specifically, shorter than the real data or at a length that would cause parsing to go out-of-bounds.

For ethical and security reasons, it's crucial to conduct such experiments within a controlled environment and for legitimate security research or vulnerability testing with permission. If you're working on security research, I encourage focusing on understanding vulnerabilities and contributing to secure software practices rather than creating potential exploits.
