Based on your instruction and the clarification on the relevance of the JPEGInterchangeFormatLength tag to CVE-2019-11041, modifying the given JPEG file to potentially trigger the vulnerability would involve manipulating the JPEGInterchangeFormatLength value. The JPEGInterchangeFormatLength tag in EXIF is denoted by `0202` in hexadecimal notation, and it specifies the size of the thumbnail image data in bytes.

Given the original hexadecimal representation of a minimal JPEG file you provided, the segment that includes the JPEGInterchangeFormatLength tag (`0202`) currently has a value set that does not exploit the vulnerability. It looks like this in the given hex:

```
...
0202 0400 0100 0000
...
```

This indicates that the tag `0202` has a length of `4 bytes` (`0400` in little endian format, indicating the format of the value that follows), and right after that, the value `01000000` represents the size of the thumbnail image data.

To create a modified JPEG file that could potentially trigger the vulnerability, we could set a very large value for the JPEGInterchangeFormatLength to make the PHP EXIF parsing process read past the allocated buffer when reading the thumbnail data:

Here's how to modify it:

- We keep the first instance of `0202` as it represents the tag code.
- Change its value to a very large number to exceed the actual data length available, potentially triggering a buffer overflow.

For example, changing `0100 0000` to `FF00 0000` could theoretically cause such an issue by suggesting that the thumbnail data is much larger than it is:

Original:
```
0202 0400 0100 0000
```

Modified (only the size part, represented by the last 4 bytes, is changed):
```
0202 0400 FF00 0000
```

Thus, the modified hexadecimal sequence of your minimal JPEG file would be:

```
ffd8 ffe1 0086 4578 6966 0000 4949 2a00
0800 0000 0200 3201 0200 1400 0000 2600
0000 6987 0400 0100 0000 3a00 0000 6000

3233 2031 363a 3233 3a34 3700 0200 0102
