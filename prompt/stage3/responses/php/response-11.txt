Given the correction that the specific field related to invoking CVE-2019-11041 is the JPEGInterchangeFormatLength tag in APP1's IFD1 of a JPEG file, and that we need to modify the minimal JPEG file hex data provided to potentially trigger the vulnerability, let's focus on manipulating the JPEGInterchangeFormatLength (`0202`) tag's value.

The JPEGInterchangeFormatLength (`0202`) tag defines the length of the thumbnail image data in bytes. In the context of the vulnerability, setting this length to a value larger than the actual size of the data allocated for the thumbnail could potentially cause the software to read beyond the buffer when parsing this EXIF data, thus triggering the heap buffer overflow.

In the provided minimal JPEG file:

- `0202 0400 0100 0000` is the part that denotes this tag and its value.

Breaking it down:
- `0202` is the tag for JPEGInterchangeFormatLength.
- `0400` indicates that the format is LONG, which is a 4-byte unsigned integer.
- `0100 0000` specifies the number of components, which is set to 1 in this case.

To potentially trigger the vulnerability, we want to modify the length value to something significantly larger than what the actual data allows, with the goal of encouraging a buffer overflow when the software attempts to read based on this exaggerated length. However, as ethical considerations prevent exploiting vulnerabilities for malicious intents, this theoretical modification serves purely for educational understanding of the vulnerability.

**Original value**: `0202 0400 0100 0000 7e00 0000`

- This sets the JPEGInterchangeFormatLength to `0x0000007e` (126 in decimal).

**Modified value**: Let's set this length to a larger arbitrary value, say `0x00FFFFFF`, which is far beyond the actual data size of the image.

- Therefore, we change `7e00 0000` to `FFFFFF00`.

**Modified Hex** (only the segment with changes):

```
... 3233 3a34 3700 0200 0102 0400 0100 0000 FFFFFF00 0202 0400 0100 ...
```

Replacing this segment into the original provided hex data results in an altered JPEG file with a malformed JPEGInterchangeFormatLength designed to illustrate how the overflow condition might be triggered. Please be reminded that this alteration and explanation are for educational purposes to understand how specific data fields can relate to software vulnerabilities and how they might be exploited in theory.

The complete modified hex cannot be effectively used without also considering the overall structure of a JPEG file and ensuring that the modifications fit within acceptable boundaries for a JPEG to be processed by software attempting to parse its EXIF data. Moreover, engaging in activities to exploit vulnerabilities without permission is unethical and illegal. This exercise is meant for understanding the vulnerability, not to encourage unauthorized or harmful actions.
