Given the explanation about CVE-2017-8393 and the importance of correctly handling the names of SHT_REL/RELA sections to avoid the vulnerability in the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library, a crafted ELF file aiming to trigger this vulnerability would need to have an SHT_REL or SHT_RELA section with a name that does not start with the assumed `.rel`/`.rela` prefixes. This is under the condition that we're exploring how the vulnerability works in a responsible manner, and have checked the specifics of the CVE to understand what kind of modifications can potentially trigger it. 

In the provided ELF file dump, there's no direct mention of section names or clear identifiers to indicate specific sections are REL/RELA without closer examination or additional context such as section headers, which provide the details about section names, types, and other attributes. However, for the sake of demonstration, let's assume there's an intention to modify the ELF to fit the scenario—while keeping in mind the action alone on such a hexadecimal representation without full context might not suffice to trigger the CVE. The real modification would involve altering the section header related to a REL/RELA section and its corresponding name in the section name string table (`.shstrtab`), if such specifics were definitively identified within the hex dump.

**Disclaimer**: The modification described below is hypothetical, aiming to understand CVE-2017-8393's technical aspects. It does not represent a direct, actionable manipulation due to the abstracted nature of the hexadecimal representation provided without the full ELF parsing context.

To illustrate a hypothetical modification that doesn't precisely match an actionable change but follows the spirit of the root cause:

1. Identify a section assumed to be REL/RELA (based on type indicated somewhere in the section header within the ELF structure).
2. Change its name entry in the string table section (`.shstrtab`) to something not starting with `.rel` or `.rela`, which should technically be located somewhere towards the end of the ELF file based on typical structure but is hard to pinpoint within the provided dump without offsets and table locations.

Given the provided dump doesn't point directly to the string table or section headers, let's hypothetically say there's a REL section named `.rel.plt` (a common name) we want to modify. Since we cannot reliably parse and alter without the entire ELF structure context here, a vivid example would look like changing:

- Original: `.rel.plt` to `.notrel.plt`

If `.rel.plt` started at an imaginary offcet and was encoded in ASCII in the hex dump, you'd directly modify the ASCII representation. Again, since there’s not a clear actionable line in the provided dump, this is a conceptual approach to how one would go about it if aiming to test the vulnerability by intentionally breaking the naming convention assumption.

Remember, to responsibly test such vulnerabilities, one should always work within a controlled environment and adhere to legal and ethical guidelines. Since the example provided does not translate directly into an immediate edit of your hex dump but rather illustrates the kind of manipulation that aligns with the CVE-2017-8393's context, anyone looking into testing or researching should rely on deeper analysis and comprehensive ELF structure understanding to apply modifications correctly.
