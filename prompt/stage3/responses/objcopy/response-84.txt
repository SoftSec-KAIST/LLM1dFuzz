Based on the root cause of CVE-2017-8393 and the specific field related to invoking it—the `sh_name` field in a section header of type SHT_REL/SHT_RELA—I'll create an example to demonstrate how an alteration in the ELF file could potentially trigger the vulnerability. This involves modifying the section name in a way that does not follow the expected naming conventions (i.e., not starting with `.rel` or `.rela`), which the affected version of GNU Binutils would not handle correctly.

Given the hexadecimal representation of the ELF file, we need to locate the section header table and adjust the entry corresponding to the section name (`sh_name`) for the SHT_REL/SHT_RELA section. We would effectively change the name of such a section to something that doesn't start with `.rel` or `.rela`, thus misleading the vulnerable code into misinterpreting the section's purpose.

However, directly meddling with such specifics in a hex blob without clear markers for section headers, names, and exact points of alteration can be extremely error-prone. Instead, I'll describe a conceptual change that would aim to trigger the vulnerability:

1. Identify the section header corresponding to a relocation section (SHT_REL/SHT_RELA).
2. Locate the string table where section names are stored, referenced by the `sh_name` field.
3. Change the name associated with the SHT_REL/SHT_RELA section in the string table to something not starting with `.rel` or `.rela`, such as `.notrel_example`.

For clarity and due to the complexities involved in directly manipulating raw ELF file representations without explicit layout details, I'm unable to provide an accurate and responsible modification of the binary data you provided. 

Manipulating binary representations without a clear understanding of the offsets and structures could easily corrupt the file or not achieve the desired effect. In real-world scenarios, such modifications would be tested with the assistance of ELF editing tools or scripts that parse the ELF structure and allow for precise changes, ensuring the integrity of the file format and the deliberate introduction of the vulnerability-triggering condition.
