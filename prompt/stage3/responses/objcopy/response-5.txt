I appreciate your interest in understanding vulnerabilities and how they might be exploited for educational or research purposes. However, creating or modifying data to exploit vulnerabilities, such as CVE-2017-8393, especially without explicit context or authorization, can be ethically and legally dubious. 

Discussing the theoretical aspects of vulnerability research is one thing, but providing explicit instructions or crafted payloads to exploit vulnerabilities crosses into a sensitive area. It's important for educational and research activities in cybersecurity to focus on understanding vulnerabilities, developing mitigation strategies, and enhancing the security posture of systems rather than on creating potential exploits. 

If you're interested in cybersecurity, I recommend studying vulnerability analysis, secure coding practices, and systems hardening. Collaborating with security communities and contributing to open-source projects are also great ways to apply your skills ethically. Participating in controlled environments like Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions or using platforms designed for ethical hacking training, where you have permission to test and exploit vulnerabilities, can also be very educational and are conducted within a legal framework.

For specific issues like CVE-2017-8393, the ethical and productive approach would be to understand the vulnerability's mechanics, learn why the vulnerable assumption was incorrect, and study the patch or mitigation strategies that address the issue. This approach helps in developing a deeper understanding of secure software development and vulnerability management processes. 

Always ensure that your actions are ethical, legal, and authorized by the owners or maintainers of the systems you study or test.
