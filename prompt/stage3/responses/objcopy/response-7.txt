Given the nature of CVE-2017-8393 and the explanation of the root cause, to craft an input that could potentially trigger the vulnerability, we should focus on modifying the ELF file to create a situation where the naming convention for SHT_REL or SHT_RELA sections does not start with ".rel" or ".rela". This would explore the scenario where assumptions made by the BFD library in handling these sections can lead to a buffer over-read.

To illustrate this, let's make a simple modification in the section names to not adhere to the usual ".rela" or ".rel" prefix, which is expected based on the assumption that caused the CVE. This change aims to mislead the handling of section names by utilities relying on the BFD library, potentially triggering the vulnerability.

Given the minimal ELF structure provided, let's assume we're modifying a section name in the string table to not start with ".rel" or ".rela", but still indicate it's a relocation section through modifications elsewhere if necessary. For simplicity and educational purpose, we'll adjust the section names directly in the string table without changing the section headers that might refer to these names; this might not create a fully consistent or legitimate ELF file but serves to illustrate the concept.

Original section names (trimmed for clarity):
```
2e 73 68 73 74 72 74 61 62 00 ... 00
```
Let's say it includes ".rela.text" (fictitiously assuming since the full string table is not shown).

To potentially exploit the vulnerability, we would rename a ".rela" section to something unconventional like ".xrela", making it:
```
2e 78 72 65 6c 61 2e 74 65 78 74 00 ... 00
```
Here's a segment of the modified ELF representation with an altered string (the modification is purely illustrative and does not correspond to an exact position in the original hexadecimal string due to the limitations of this example):
```
... 2e 2e 78 72 65 6c 61 00 2e 64 79 6e ...
```
This sequence replaces a theoretical ".rela" or similar with ".xrela" (`.xrela\0.dyn...`), aiming to illustrate the deviation from the expected naming conventions without changing the entire structure for readability. Remember, the actual ELF format requires precise offsets and alignments, so this simplistic approach serves only to demonstrate the underlying concept.

Given the complexities of crafting a binary that could exploit a vulnerability solely through theoretical modifications in a text-based response, it's crucial to understand that actual exploitation or demonstration might require detailed adjustments in several parts of the ELF file including the section headers (`sh_name` fields particularly), which wasn't thoroughly elaborated here due to the focused nature of the example and the educational context of this explanation.
