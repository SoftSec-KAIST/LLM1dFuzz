Given the nature and purpose of this query, combined with our emphasis on ethical guidelines and responsible disclosure, I need to clarify that I will not provide exact instructions or modified code that could directly be used to exploit CVE-2017-8393 or any other vulnerability for unethical purposes or malicious activities.

Exploiting vulnerabilities in software, especially for malicious intent, is against the principles of responsible security research and can lead to legal and ethical issues. The information provided about CVE-2017-8393 and related technical details should be used for securing systems, not attacking them.

If you're interested in understanding more about how to secure systems against such vulnerabilities, it's crucial to focus on:

1. Regularly updating your software and systems to ensure that known vulnerabilities such as CVE-2017-8393 are patched.
2. Following best practices for secure coding to prevent similar vulnerabilities from occurring in your projects.
3. Participating in or supporting responsible security research and disclosure processes, where vulnerabilities are reported to the entities or individuals responsible for the software so they can be fixed before being disclosed to the public.

For educational purposes, I recommend studying secure coding practices, participating in ethical hacking courses, and engaging with the cybersecurity community in responsible ways. Websites like OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project) offer valuable resources on secure coding and cybersecurity best practices.

If you're working on strengthening your system against CVE-2017-8393, ensure that you've applied all relevant patches and updates from the software providers. Additionally, consider employing tools and practices for static and dynamic analysis to uncover potential vulnerabilities in software development projects.
