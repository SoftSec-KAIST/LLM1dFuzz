To potentially invoke CVE-2017-8393, we need to focus on crafting or modifying an ELF file in such a way that it includes a section name for a `SHT_REL` or `SHT_RELA` section that does not start with `.rel` or `.rela`. This is because the vulnerability is due to the handling of relocation sections whose names do not follow the expected conventions. However, CVE-2017-8393 mainly results in a crash due to a buffer over-read, and exploiting it for arbitrary code execution or other malicious purposes would depend on various factors including the specific environment and use case.

**Note: The following exercise is purely academic and should only be pursued with ethical intent and in environments where such testing is authorized.**

Given the minimal example and the intent to modify it for educational purposes, let's focus on the hex representation that corresponds to section names, and introduce a section name that does not conform to the expectations (not starting with `.rel` or `.rela`).

Given ELF hex dump, section names might typically appear towards the end, as they are part of the section header string table. Based on the original hex, let's assume we have a section that's supposed to be a relocation section, and we will modify its name:

Original (hypothetical) section names might end with:
```
2e7368737472746162002e64796e73796d002e64796e73747200
```
Which translates to:
```
.shstrtab.dynsym.dynstr
```

Let's introduce a relocation section name that doesn't start with `.rel` or `.rela`, say `.not_relsec` instead of `.rela.dynsym` for example. We will replace the `.dynsym` string to keep the example simple, without extending the size of the file (which would require adjustments in several places, including section header offsets and sizes). The adjusted hex value for the string table part would then change as follows:

Original:
```
2e7368737472746162002e64796e73796d002e64796e73747200
```
Modified (replacing `.dynsym` with `.not_relsec`):
```
2e7368737472746162002e6e6f745f72656c736563002e64796e73747200
```

Inserting this directly into the original hex string would disrupt the given example since we're not pointing to a real section header or adjusting any other parts of the ELF file to accommodate a completely valid structure for analysis. Normally, you would need to also update section headers to point to this new string (by adjusting offsets, types, and other relevant fields) and possibly add other relevant sections (like the actual relocation data).

However, for the sake of illustrating how the name might be inserted into the example—and because modifying an ELF file for this purpose involves changes that go well beyond simply replacing strings in the hex dump—I’ll emphasize that crafting a malicious input requires careful construction of all parts of the ELF file, ensuring the file structure is internally consistent and matches expected formats for parsing.
