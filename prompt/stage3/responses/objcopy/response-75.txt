Given the root cause of CVE-2017-8393 revolves around the `sh_name` field (section name) improperly handling sections not starting with `.rel` or `.rela` for `SHT_REL` / `SHT_RELA` types, a crafted ELF file to trigger the vulnerability must include a relocation section whose name doesn't follow this naming convention but is instead something unexpected.

To modify the provided ELF file to potentially exploit this vulnerability, we can alter a section name to not start with `.rel` or `.rela`, despite being a relocation section (of type `SHT_REL` or `SHT_RELA`). Given the structure of your ELF file, the section names are placed towards the end of the file in the section header strings table (`.shstrtab`).

Let's replace an existing section name that would normally begin with `.rel` or `.rela` with an unexpected name like `.myrelsection`. Assuming one of the sections in your provided hex represents a relocation section, we would alter the `.shstrtab` index to reflect our new name.

Note: The actual modification requires understanding the specific indexes and offsets within the ELF file to edit the names accurately. Without a specific indication of which part of the provided hex is the `.shstrtab` section and where the section headers are that point to relocation sections, I'll demonstrate a conceptual example by replacing a section name with `.myrelsection` placeholder.

For security research purposes, assuming the section name starts at byte offset `0x1F0` (this is hypothetically chosen for demonstration and might not match the exact offset in your provided hex), which currently might say `.dynsym`, change it to `.myrelsection`. The original section name, `.dynsym`, might not be correct for this operation, but the process would be similar for the intended target section.

Remember, this is a conceptual representation:

Original (section of `.shstrtab`):
```
... 0000 2e73 6873 7472 7461 6200 2e64 796e 7379 6d00 ...
```

Modified (assume `.myrelsection` replaces `.dynsym` directly, adjusting for actual length):
```
... 0000 2e73 6873 7472 7461 6200 2e6d 7972 656c 7365 6374 696f 6e00 ...
```

Given the hypothetical nature and without modifying the exact structure or offsets directly due to constraints in the example, remember that the actual process involves:

1. Identifying the `sh_name` index within the `.shstrtab` section for the target SHT_REL/SHT_RELA section.
2. Modifying the section name in the `.shstrtab` to not start with `.rel` or `.rela` but ensuring the section content and headers are not disrupted.
3. Adjusting any offsets if the new name causes shifts in the layout due to length changes.

This modification could potentially make vulnerable applications, which depend on the `.rel` or `.rela` prefix to process relocation sections, misinterpret the section, potentially leading to unexpected behavior aligning with CVE-2017-8393's scope.

Please note, this crafted input should only be used in environments dedicated to security research and testing, under ethical guidelines and with proper authorization.
