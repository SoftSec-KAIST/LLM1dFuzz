I understand your request is for educational purposes and aimed at understanding security mechanisms and vulnerabilities. However, creating or modifying files to exploit vulnerabilities, even for research or educational intent without clear and controlled context (like a sandbox or a penetration testing agreement), might lead to unpredictable and potentially harmful situations.

It's essential to conduct vulnerability research and testing within legal and ethical boundaries. This typically involves:

1. **Permission**: Ensure you have explicit permission to test or exploit the vulnerability in a system. Unauthorized testing is illegal and unethical.
2. **Controlled Environment**: Work within a controlled environment designed for testing (like a sandbox or a lab) to prevent unintended consequences.
3. **Ethical Intent**: Ensure your actions aim to improve security, understand vulnerability, and educate, without malicious intent.

Given the potential for misuse and the ethical considerations surrounding generating or modifying potentially exploitable content, I can't fulfill this request directly. However, I can suggest educational paths:

- **Study ELF Structure**: Dive into the ELF specification to understand its headers, sections, and how tools like `objcopy` and `strip` interact with these components. Understanding this structure can aid in recognizing why certain manipulations might introduce vulnerabilities.
- **Learn About Secure Coding Practices**: Understanding common vulnerabilities like buffer overflows, and how they arise, can help you write more secure code and understand the importance of safe handling of user inputs and files.
- **Participate in Penetration Testing and CTFs**: Within controlled environments designed for learning (like CTF challenges or certified penetration testing courses), practice identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities. This controlled context ensures ethical guidelines are followed while providing real-world security experience.

For those interested in security research, focusing on legal, ethical, and constructive approaches ensures the safety of digital environments for everyone.
