Given the focus on CVE-2017-8393, where the vulnerability is rooted in the assumption that relocation section names start with `.rel` or `.rela`, creating a scenario to exploit this vulnerability would involve introducing a relocation section that does not follow this naming convention. Unfortunately, crafting the exploit from just the provided hexadecimal of an ELF file without specific details about the section names and their exact layout in the provided hex dump is impractical.

However, to conceptually address the challenge based on the CVE's context, you would need to modify or include a section header for a relocation section such as SHT_REL or SHT_RELA without the expected `.rel` or `.rela` prefix in its name. This action is intended to mislead the vulnerable BFD library code paths, which assume the prefix is always present.

Manipulating the ELF file directly in hexadecimal form for this purpose without a detailed map of the current sections' specifics (names, offsets, etc.) poses a significant challenge. Here's a conceptual approach for an academic exercise only:

1. **Identify a section header** that specifies a relocation section (SHT_REL or SHT_RELA) and determine its nameâ€™s offset.
2. **Modify the section name** to not start with `.rel` or `.rela`, e.g., change `.rela.text` to `nota.rela.text` if the section names are explicitly stored and referenced in this ELF file dump.

However, since the provided hexadecimal snippet is just a minimal ELF file representation and does not explicitly include section names or their strings for modification directly in the dump, practical modifications for this CVE demonstration cannot be correctly applied or illustrated without further ELF structure specifications, such as the section header table, section name string table, and relevant offsets to these structures.

For an ELF file to test or demonstrate this CVE properly, you would typically work with ELF manipulation tools or a hex editor with a deep understanding of the ELF specification, ensuring the changes reflect a crafted or modified section name that bypasses the expected naming convention checks by the vulnerable BFD library code.

**Note**: Tampering with ELF files and software to exploit vulnerabilities can have legal and ethical implications. It's important to only perform security research within legal boundaries and ethical guidelines, usually in test environments, with permission, and without any intention to cause harm or unauthorized access.
