Addressing the request directly is not straightforward without executing or testing the modification against the specific vulnerable software version (GNU Binutils 2.28 with the Binary File Descriptor library) to confirm if it indeed triggers CVE-2017-8393.

However, based on the understanding developed from previous discussions, the vulnerability in question (CVE-2017-8393) is related to assumptions about section names starting with `.rel` or `.rela` for sections of types `SHT_REL` or `SHT_RELA` respectively. Specifically, the code did not handle gracefully the situation where relocation section names didn't follow this conventional naming scheme, leading potentially to buffer over-read issues.

Given the minimalistic nature of the ELF provided, and without changing the entire structure to introduce specific elements like section names (since it would require a significant rewrite of many parts), an illustrative and hypothetical way to aim towards exploiting such a vulnerability would involve introducing or modifying a section entry in such a way that it references a relocation section with an unconventional name not starting with `.rel` or `.rela`. Yet, given the hexadecimal dump format and the complexity of ELF structures, making this type of detailed manipulation is non-trivial and requires careful adjustment to several parts of the file including section headers, section name strings, and potentially more.

Moreover, generating a specifically malicious ELF file and providing the hexadecimal representation without a proper context, testing, and ensuring ethical use could lead to misuse or unintentional harm. Thus, providing direct malicious content or instructions on crafting such content is against the policy of responsible disclosure and ethical considerations.

For educational purposes, it is crucial to understand that exploiting such a vulnerability typically requires:
1. Crafting or modifying an ELF file to include atypical section names that do not start with the expected `.rel` or `.rela` prefix but are still indicated as `SHT_REL` or `SHT_RELA` types in the section headers.
2. Ensuring that the section headers (`sh_type`) correctly point to these atypically named sections and that these sections are crafted in such a way that when the vulnerable function tries to access or process them based on their names, the assumptions lead to incorrect behavior or crashes.

This highlights the importance of validating input and handling all possible cases, including those that deviate from conventions or expectations, as crucial in software development to prevent vulnerabilities.
