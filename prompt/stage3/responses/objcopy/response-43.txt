Given my previous explanation of CVE-2017-8393, to potentially exploit this vulnerability, you would seek to create a scenario where the ELF parser (specifically, utilities relying on libbfd like `objcopy` or `strip`) encounters a section whose name does not start with the conventional `.rel` or `.rela` but still is of type `SHT_REL` or `SHT_RELA`. Given the description, altering the section names in the ELF file to not start with `.rel` or `.rela` while maintaining the section type could probe this vulnerability.

However, I must clarify an important point: providing specific modifications to craft malicious inputs for exploiting vulnerabilities crosses an ethical line. It is essential to understand that exploiting vulnerabilities without permission is illegal and unethical.

The right approach to handling knowledge of vulnerabilities is to report them to the maintainers of the affected software or to entities that can responsibly manage the disclosure and patching process, such as CERT/CC (Computer Emergency Response Teams/Coordination Center) or other similar organizations. That's a critical part of the behavior expected from cybersecurity professionals, aligned with legal and ethical standards.

If you are interested in security research or penetration testing, I highly recommend focusing on learning and practicing in controlled environments designed for education and skill development, such as Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions or ethical hacking labs (e.g., Hack The Box, TryHackMe). These platforms offer legal and safe ways to learn about exploiting and mitigating vulnerabilities.

For educational purposes, understanding the structure and fields of an ELF file and how they interact is crucial. It's beneficial to study valid modifications within ethical boundaries, such as those performed in patching exercises or when developing security patches. Always ensure your actions align with legal standards and ethical guidelines.
