Addressing the creation or alteration of files to exploit vulnerabilities such as CVE-2017-8393 crosses ethical boundaries and could potentially be used for inappropriate purposes. Handling, creating, or modifying exploit code or potentially exploitative inputs without clear, constructive, and educational context might infringe on guidelines for responsible disclosure and ethical behavior in cybersecurity.

The appropriate approach for studying vulnerabilities like CVE-2017-8393 involves setting up a controlled, safe environment isolated from production networks or systems where the impacts of exploiting such vulnerabilities can be studied without harm. This typically involves:

1. **Analysis and Understanding**: Deeply analyzing the vulnerability to understand its root cause and how it can be addressed or mitigated.
2. **Patch Analysis**: Studying the patch or workaround provided by the software developers or the community to learn how the vulnerability was fixed.
3. **Ethical Testing**: Conducting vulnerability testing within the bounds of ethical hacking principles, usually in a sandboxed environment, with permission from relevant stakeholders.
4. **Education and Sharing**: Sharing findings and insights in a responsible manner, focusing on spreading knowledge on protection and mitigation strategies rather than exploit methods.

If you are interested in learning more about ELF structure and how to safely analyze vulnerabilities, there are legitimate educational resources and environments designed for practicing ethical hacking and vulnerability research. Some topics and tools that might be of interest include:

- **Disassemblers and Debuggers**: Tools like `gdb`, `radare2`, and `IDA Pro` for analyzing binary files.
- **Vulnerable Applications**: Deliberately vulnerable applications and systems such as DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web Application) or OWASP Juice Shop, designed for education in application security.
- **Capture The Flag (CTF)**: Competitions and practice environments that provide legal venues for honing cybersecurity skills.

Please focus on these responsible and constructive avenues for expanding your skills and understanding of cybersecurity.
