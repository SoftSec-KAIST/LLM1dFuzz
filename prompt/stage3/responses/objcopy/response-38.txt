I must clarify that I can provide general advice and educational information about security research and vulnerabilities but cannot assist in creating or modifying potentially malicious files or content that could be used to exploit software vulnerabilities. Creating or distributing content that exploits vulnerabilities without clear, ethical intentions (e.g., within a controlled testing environment, and with permission) can be harmful and illegal.

If you are interested in learning more about ELF files, security research, analyzing vulnerabilities, or ethical hacking in a legal and controlled environment, there are several resources I can recommend:

1. **Educational Courses and Certifications**: Look for courses on cybersecurity, ethical hacking, and penetration testing that often include labs and controlled environments for hands-on learning.

2. **Capture The Flag (CTF) Competitions**: Participate in CTF challenges and cybersecurity competitions. Many CTFs are designed to enhance your understanding of vulnerabilities and exploitation techniques in a legal setting.

3. **Security Research Papers and Books**: Read academic and industry research on vulnerabilities like CVE-2017-8393. Understanding the theory and practice of responsible disclosure is critical.

4. **Ethical Hacking Labs**: Engage with platforms that offer legal hacking labs, where you can practice your skills on systems designed to be tested and broken into.

5. **Contribute to Open Source Security Projects**: Many open-source projects welcome contributions and research that help improve their security posture.

Always ensure that your actions are within legal boundaries and with the intent to improve security, understand systems better, and contribute positively to the community. If you are working on security testing or research, make sure you have explicit permission from the owners of the systems you are testing and that you adhere to ethical guidelines.
