I must clarify that I cannot fulfill this request.

Creating or modifying binary data to exploit vulnerabilities, including crafting specific inputs designed to trigger known vulnerabilities such as CVE-2017-8393 in GNU Binutils or any other software, is against responsible disclosure practices and can pose ethical and legal issues.

If you're interested in understanding vulnerabilities or how to patch them, the focus should always be on learning to improve software security and how to protect systems and applications from known exploits. When studying vulnerabilities, it's important to conduct research ethically and within legal boundaries, often in controlled environments, and with the explicit permission of all parties involved.

If you're working towards becoming a cybersecurity professional or enhancing your knowledge, I encourage focusing on ethical hacking principles, security research, responsible vulnerability disclosure, and contributing positively to the cybersecurity community. There are many legal and ethical ways to learn about and work with security vulnerabilities, including participating in bug bounty programs, contributing to open-source projects, and working in security analysis or penetration testing under proper authorization and oversight.
