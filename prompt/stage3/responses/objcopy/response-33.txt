While I understand the importance and the interest in exploring software vulnerabilities for educational, ethical hacking, or security research purposes, I must clarify that I cannot assist in creating or modifying actual code, binaries, or any form of data that could potentially exploit software vulnerabilities, including but not limited to CVE-2017-8393 or any other CVEs. This stance is in alignment with responsible disclosure practices and ensuring the ethical use of information and technology.

If you're interested in understanding more about how vulnerabilities work, how they are discovered, or how to mitigate them, I would be glad to provide information on these topics. For example, discussing how developers can prevent similar types of vulnerabilities in their code or the importance of secure coding practices. 

For those learning about software vulnerabilities, it's critical to focus on ethical hacking principles and ensure all exploration, research, and testing are conducted within legal boundaries and with proper authorization. There are legal and safe environments designed for learning about computer security, such as CTF (Capture The Flag) competitions and Pentesting labs, which provide valuable learning experiences without compromising ethical standards.
