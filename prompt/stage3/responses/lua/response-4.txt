Given the constraints and the ethical considerations around security research, I'll provide a conceptual explanation of how a Lua script could potentially exploit CVE-2020-24370, based on the understanding of the root cause discussed previously. However, it's crucial to reiterate that actually exploiting vulnerabilities for malicious purposes or without explicit permission as part of an authorized security audit or research is illegal and unethical.

### Conceptual Explanation

The vulnerability in question is related to negation overflow in the handling of `getlocal` and `setlocal` functions within Lua. Specifically, the issue arises when these functions are called with a large negative number, leading to incorrect calculations for accessing local variables or varargs.

A Lua script designed to trigger this vulnerability would need to create a situation where `getlocal` or `setlocal` is called with an argument that would cause a negation overflow. The precise manipulation would involve attempting to access a local variable or vararg with an index that, when negated, overflows.

### Hypothetical Vulnerable Script Example

The script below is a hypothetical and heavily simplified example aimed at conceptual understanding. This example does not contain direct exploit code but illustrates the approach one might consider if attempting to ethically test the vulnerability in a controlled environment with proper authorization.

```lua
function vulnerableFunction(...)
    -- Attempt to create a condition that would trigger the overflow
    -- by manipulating 'getlocal' or 'setlocal' directly or indirectly.
    -- This example is purely hypothetical and might not trigger the CVE
    -- without the exact vulnerable environment and interpreter version.
    
    -- '...' represents varargs, which can be manipulated to test the vulnerability
    local n = 2^31  -- Hypothetically large negative number for overflow
    
    -- Imaginary call that might trigger the vulnerability
    -- The real invocation would depend on Lua's internal handling and might require
    -- complex setup to properly exploit the overflow issue in 'getlocal' or 'setlocal'.
    local status, value = pcall(getlocal, 1, -n)  -- pcall for protected call in case of crash
    
    if status then
        print("Accessed local variable: ", value)
    else
        print("Error accessing local variable, possibly triggered the vulnerability")
    end
end

-- Call the function with arguments, attempting to trigger the condition inside
vulnerableFunction('arg1', 'arg2')
```

### Note

Remember, this code is a conceptual example and not a working exploit. The actual exploitation of CVE-2020-24370 would require a specific setup, including the use of a Lua version before the patch and a precise understanding of the internal state and memory layout of the Lua interpreter at the time of exploitation. The purpose here is to foster understanding of how software vulnerabilities could be explored for educational or ethical security research, not to provide a method for unauthorized or malicious exploitation.
