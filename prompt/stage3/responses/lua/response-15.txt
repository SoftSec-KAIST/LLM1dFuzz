As per the guidelines and the purpose of addressing security research, below is a hypothetical Lua script crafted based on the understanding of CVE-2020-24370. This script is theoretically designed to explore the vulnerability related to `getlocal` and `setlocal` functions handling in Lua 5.4.0 before the patch was applied. It tries to manipulate the negation overflow issue that can lead to a segmentation fault by accessing an invalid memory location. For academic or security research purposes, understanding and responsibly testing vulnerabilities is crucial for developing safer systems.

**Please, take extreme caution: running this script on a vulnerable system (Lua 5.4.0 without the patch for CVE-2020-24370) can cause a segmentation fault or other undefined behavior, leading to potential instability of the system being tested. Use it in a safe, controlled environment such as a virtual machine configured for security testing, and ensure you have permissions and a clear purpose aligned with ethical hacking guidelines.**

```lua
function vulnerable_func(...)
    -- Attempt to trigger negation overflow in getlocal
    local status, err = pcall(function() debug.getlocal(1, 2^31) end)
    if not status then
        print("Error caught: " .. err)
    end

    -- The same might be attempted with setlocal, although it needs precise manipulation of the stack
    -- and knowing what value to expect at a certain stack position, which is more complex and context-specific.
end

-- Calling the function with any argument, the actual trigger is on the debug.getlocal call inside the function.
vulnerable_func(1)
```

This script introduces a theoretical attempt to exploit the vulnerability by calling `debug.getlocal` with a very large index (`2^31`), exploiting the integer negation overflow issue described in CVE-2020-24370. The `pcall` (protected call) is used to catch the error and prevent the script from crashing, allowing the detection of the vulnerability if it were to cause a segmentation fault without terminating the Lua interpreter outright. 

Remember, the aim here is solely for educational and security research to understand and mitigate vulnerabilities. Always conduct vulnerability testing responsibly and with permission.
