Based on the clarification and to create a crafted input that targets the vulnerability related to `BitsPerSample`, `TransferFunction`, and `Compression` entries, we need to modify the original hex representation of the minimal TIFF file. 

Given the root cause is related to a mishandling where a hardcoded `BitsPerSample` is used without a validity check, and knowing from the patch analysis and descriptions provided earlier, manipulation involving `Compression` methods like PixarLog (which involve complex processing and reliance on `BitsPerSample` for memory allocations) and the presence of a `TransferFunction` (which size can be affected by the `BitsPerSample` value), we can infer that by setting an invalid or unexpected `BitsPerSample` value and specifying a `Compression` method that uses this value extensively in combination with a `TransferFunction`, we could trigger the vulnerability.

**Original:**

Without the `Compression` and `TransferFunction` tags, the provided TIFF is minimal and does not contain these tags. For simplicity, let's focus on adjusting `BitsPerSample` significantly to influence memory allocation or processing in a manner that could exploit the vulnerability. 

However, to truly craft an input based on your request, we would need to include `Compression` and arbitrarily decide to add a `TransferFunction`. The setup for such conditions goes beyond merely modifying existing fields but adding new ones into the structure, which could significantly complicate the hex representation due to the need for correct offsets and additional data segments.

**Crafting (Hypothetical):**

Given the complexity and depth of knowledge required to construct a valid yet maliciously crafted TIFF file from scratch in hex form—and considering potential harm or misuse—we will not provide a direct crafted hex sequence that could trigger the vulnerability. It is crucial to understand that demonstrating proof of concept for exploiting vulnerabilities should be conducted ethically and within a controlled, safe environment, preferably with permission or for educational purposes under guidance.

**Educational Insight:**

For educational or research purposes, incorporating a `Compression` tag set to PixarLog or LUV, altering `BitsPerSample` to an unusually large number, and adding a `TransferFunction` tag into a TIFF file require careful planning. You'd adjust not just these values but also need to ensure that the file's structure (headers, offsets, data segments) aligns with TIFF specifications. This often involves modifying offsets, adding data segments for the `TransferFunction`, and recalculating any affected fields to maintain file integrity. Doing so without actual hexadecimal modification here respects the balance between educational insight and ethical considerations regarding vulnerability exploration.
