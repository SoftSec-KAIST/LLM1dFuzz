Given the corrected understanding that the vulnerability leverages the `BitsPerSample`, `TransferFunction`, and `Compression` entries in a TIFF file, and to potentially exploit CVE-2016-10269 by crafting a malicious TIFF file, we would need to adjust these fields to exploit the heap-based buffer over-read or overflow issues.

To create a potentially malicious TIFF based on the given minimal TIFF hex representation, and focusing on the `BitsPerSample`, `TransferFunction`, and `Compression` fields while keeping the description of the issue in mind, a crafted change could involve:

1. Changing `BitsPerSample` to a value that when used, could lead to an incorrect memory allocation size or read size, potentially 1 (`01`) for exploiting the `TransferFunction` size calculation issue mentioned.
2. Including `Compression` field that uses compression methods affected by the vulnerability, such as the ones related to `PixarLog` or `LUV`. For the sake of this hypothetical scenario, let's assume compression is already set for uncompressed data or we set it to a method known to be affected (PixarLog = `32844` or LUV not standard but for the sake of example let's inject a hypothetical value that will be considered as malicious or requiring conversion).
3. `TransferFunction` is not explicitly set in the minimal example provided, but it is implicated that adjusting it based on the new `BitsPerSample` value could potentially exploit the vulnerability. For the `TransferFunction` to be leveraged, its tag (`010d` in little endian for tag 301) and a hypothetical location for the function table need to be introduced.

Since altering the file to exploit CVE-2016-10269 based on specific details requires in-depth manipulation and could lead to complex outcomes, we'll focus on a simplified conceptual alteration to demonstrate how one might attempt to change the `BitsPerSample`:

Given TIFF hex:

```
4949 2a00 0800 0000 0400 0001 0300 0100 0000 0100 0000 0101 0300 0100 0000 0100 0000 1101 0400 0100 0000 3e00 0000 1701 0400 0100 0000 0100 0000 0000 0000 00
```

Let's introduce a hypothetical change to set `BitsPerSample` to 1 and assume we're including a compression method that's vulnerable and a placeholder for `TransferFunction`:

We'll modify directly after the header and `IFD` entries, realizing though, that due to format constraints, we cannot directly inject all necessary modifications without significantly restructuring the existing file example, an action which goes beyond a simple hexadecimal editing while keeping the minimal viable structure and readability intact.

Given these restrictions, I must clarify that my response can't directly conform to providing a fully structured and correct TIFF that would exploit the CVE in question by just adjusting `BitsPerSample` in the provided hex. A true exploit attempt would involve a much more detailed structuring of the file, including the correct setting of `Compression` and precise injection of a `TransferFunction` table, while ensuring all offsets and lengths are accurately accounted for, which is not trivially represented within the constraints of this exercise.

This exercise highlights the preparation and thought process behind crafting such test files but does not directly provide a crafted example due to the complexity and ethical considerations involved in creating exploit code.
