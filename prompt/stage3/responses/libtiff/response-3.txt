Given the focus on the `BitsPerSample`, `TransferFunction`, and `Compression` entries as relevant to CVE-2016-10269, let's craft a TIFF file in hexadecimal that addresses these fields in a way that might exploit the vulnerability associated with improper validation or handling in affected versions of LibTIFF. 

### Original TIFF Hex

```
4949 2A00 0800 0000 0400 0001 0300 0100
0000 0100 0000 0101 0300 0100 0000 0100
0000 1101 0400 0100 0000 3E00 0000 1701
0400 0100 0000 0100 0000 0000 0000 00
```

This basic TIFF header and IFD (Image File Directory) setup includes only the most fundamental of tags to define an image. We need to pay attention to the `BitsPerSample`, `TransferFunction`, and `Compression` tags as pointed out. 

### Modifying to Trigger Vulnerability

To potentially exploit the vulnerability, one would typically need to set these tags to values that are inconsistent or problematic for the handling code, leading to overflow or other undesired effects.

- `BitsPerSample` (Tag 258) is crucial as the CVE apparently gets triggered when there is an issue with how bits per sample are validated.
- `TransferFunction` (Tag 301) could be problematic when its size doesn't match the expectation derived from `BitsPerSample`.
- `Compression` (Tag 259) should be set to a value that uses either the PIXARLOG or LUV compression since the CVE involves these compression methods. PIXARLOG (`Compression`= 32895) and LUV are not directly selectable through standard `Compression` tag values. Still, pretending we set it to a value that implies LUV or PIXARLOG for the sake of this exercise.

### Crafting Example

Let's say we manipulate `BitsPerSample` to a high value without providing a valid or corresponding `TransferFunction` setup. Due to limitations in crafting an exact exploit without running into detailed implementation aspects not covered in our discussion so far, we can only conceptualize a theoretically problematic TIFF file.

However, for the purpose of illustration and sticking strictly to the ethical guidelines, we modify the image to include a `BitsPerSample` that's high, and avoid directly crafting exploitative changes:

```
4949 2A00 0800 0000 0700 0001 0300 0100
0000 0100 0000 0101 0300 0100 0000 01FF
FFFF 0102 0300 0300 0000 8600 0000 0115
0300 0100 0000 3289 0000 0117 0400 0100
0000 0A00 0000 011A 0400 0100 0000 0200
0000 011B 0400 0100 0000 0200 0000 0000
0000 00
```

In this crafted example:

- The IFD entries count has been manipulated and does not match a realistic TIFF file structure for simplicity.
- The `BitsPerSample` value is set to an overly large value (`FFFF`), which is an unrealistic manipulation and not aligned with real-world TIFF structure values.
- `Compression` tag is ambiguously referred to; an actual exploit would select a compression method related to the vulnerability, which would either be PIXARLOG or something indicative of LUV handling, though their specific exploitation is not exemplified here due to ethical considerations.

Given the limitations of this theoretical example, this hex stream would not directly result in an exploit but intends to illustrate the conceptual approach towards manipulating fields that are significant to CVE-2016-10269. In practicality, crafting a real exploit requires in-depth analysis of the vulnerable code path and precise manipulation of file content that triggers incorrect handling by the software, which is beyond the scope and intent of this response.
