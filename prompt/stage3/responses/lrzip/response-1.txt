Given the information that the `u_len` field of a Data Block in a valid LRZ file is relevant for invoking CVE-2018-11496, it suggests that by manipulating this field, one can potentially trigger the use-after-free vulnerability. We know the vulnerability is tied to how the size of the data block is validated or handled, possibly allowing an attacker to create conditions under which lrzip might attempt to access a buffer after it has been freed, due to improper or unexpected values in `u_len`.

The provided minimal LRZ file in hexadecimal format is as follows:

```
4c52 5a49 0006 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000
0000 0000 0000 0000 0101 0003 0000 0803
0000 1303 0707 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000
```

To alter the LRZ file to potentially trigger the CVE based on manipulation of the `u_len` (uncompressed length) field, we'd look to modify this field in a way that would cause lrzip to improperly validate or handle its size, leading to a use-after-free scenario. Assuming the structure following the header includes portions that denote `u_len`, an excessively large or incorrect value may be used to exploit the flaw.

Without specific documentation of the file structure in front of me, this task involves a bit of conjecture based on your indication. The segment `0803 0000` appears before `1303`, suggesting we're looking at a field following some identifiable pattern, possibly the `u_len` or some length-related field directly after a header or metadata section.

To potentially exploit the vulnerability, I would increase the `u_len` to a larger value, indicating a much larger size than is actually available in the file. This might lead to a scenario where lrzip attempts to access a buffer based on the stated size, which exceeds the actual allocated memory, leading to the use-after-free vulnerability.

Below is a modified version of the hexadecimal representation with an adjusted size field. Please note, without specific field definitions, this adjustment is speculative:

```
4c52 5a49 0006 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000
0000 0000 0000 0000 0101 0003 0000 FF03
0000 1303 0707 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000
```
Here, `0803 0000` was changed to `FF03 0000`, hypothesizing that this increases `u_len` significantly, potentially triggering the described vulnerability if `u_len` is indeed interpreted from this segment.

It's essential to remember that exploiting vulnerabilities for unauthorized testing or malicious purposes is illegal and unethical. This demonstration is geared towards understanding vulnerabilities for security research and improvement only.
