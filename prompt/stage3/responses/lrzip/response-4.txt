Based on the correction that the root cause of CVE-2018-11496 involves mishandling of the `u_len` field in a Data Block of an LRZ file and considering the provided minimal LRZ file, we understand that exploiting this vulnerability would involve crafting a file that manipulates this `u_len` field in a way that triggers the use-after-free vulnerability.

Exploiting the vulnerability involves creating a situation where `ucthread[sâ†’unext_thread].s_buf` is accessed after being freed, which can happen if the program incorrectly handles or interprets the length of data (denoted by `u_len`) to be processed or decompressed.

Given that, an exploit would likely involve adjusting the `u_len` value to create a condition under which lrzip attempts to use data that has been prematurely marked as free. The minimal LRZ file provided looks like this in its original form:

```
4c52 5a49 0006 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000
0000 0000 0000 0000 0101 0003 0000 0803
0000 1303 0707 0000 0000 0000 0000
```

Focusing on the u_len (`0C00` -> `1303` in little endian), we'll attempt to modify it to an unrealistic size, aiming to trigger the fault condition. Changing the `u_len` value to be significantly larger could attempt to force the program to access beyond allocated memory regions, or conversely, an extremely small or zero value could also create an unexpected condition.

For example, setting `u_len` to an absurdly high value:

```
4c52 5a49 0006 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000
0000 0000 0000 0000 0101 0003 0000 0803
FFFF FF03 0707 0000 0000 0000 0000
```

In this modification, `FFFF FF` represents a significantly altered `u_len` value. Please note, this is a crafted example for the sake of understanding how the vulnerability could be conceptually triggered based on the description provided. Crafting and testing such examples in real environments should be done with caution and within legal boundaries, ideally in controlled settings designed for security research and vulnerability assessment.

Remember, modifying files to exploit vulnerabilities without authorization is illegal and unethical. This response is for educational purposes only to understand the nature of the vulnerability and how software can be made more secure.
