Given the corrected information that the `u_len` field of a Data Block in a valid LRZ file is relevant for invoking CVE-2018-11496, and understanding that the root cause is related to mishandling of this field which can lead to a use-after-free vulnerability, we can attempt to craft a modified hexadecimal representation of an LRZ file that might trigger the vulnerability. This crafted input would aim to exploit the lack of validation for decompressed data sizes (`u_len`) and manipulate it to demonstrate improper memory management.

To potentially trigger the vulnerability, we would need to alter the `u_len` (uncompressed length) field in a way that misrepresents the actual size of the decompressed data, leading the application to either access memory that it shouldn't (due to expecting more data than is actually available) or to mishandle the allocated buffer for the decompressed data. 

Given the original minimal hexadecimal representation of an LRZ file provided:

```
4c52 5a49 0006 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000
0000 0000 0000 0000 0101 0003 0000 0803
0000 1303 0707 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000
```

Let's say the relevant `u_len` field that we aim to manipulate is represented as `0803` in the given hex (not explicitly distinguished here due to the lack of a breakdown for each field). We could modify this value to something significantly larger, intending to create a discrepancy between the expected data size and the actual data available, which could in turn trigger improper handling by the application if it tries to access or process more data than what is actually provided. 

However, without an exact breakdown of the LRZ file structure here and clear identification of each part, including the `u_len` field within your hex representation, directly manipulating a specific value risks being somewhat speculative. Nevertheless, adjusting a value that represents data length to a larger size than what follows or is allocated could provoke the kind of issue described as the vulnerability. If `0803` (interpreted in little-endian as 31488 bytes) is our target and we modify it to an exaggerated length:

From:
```
... 0803 ...
```

To (as an arbitrary larger value, for example, flipping this to `FFFF` to suggest an unexpectedly large size):
```
... FFFF ...
```

The revised hex sequence (fictitiously modifying a specified value without precise mapping to the `u_len` field due to provided data constraints) would be:
```
4c52 5a49 0006 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000
0000 0000 0000 0000 0101 0003 0000 FFFF
0000 1303 0707 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000
```

This modification aims to trigger the improper handling based on the incorrect assumption about data size, potentially exploiting the use-after-free vulnerability by encouraging the application to access beyond the allocated buffer. Nonetheless, the actual exploitability would depend on various factors, including specific application logic, memory alignment, and the presence of additional checks beyond the patch discussed.

Always use such crafted inputs responsibly and within the scope of authorized security research or testing engagements.
