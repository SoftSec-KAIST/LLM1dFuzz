Given the requirement involves crafting input that plays with the `u_len` field of a Data Block in a LRZ file, and considering the root cause and how the CVE is related to improperly handling memory due to not correctly validating or incorrectly setting the length of decompressed data (`u_len`), I'd modify the LRZ file to manipulate the `u_len` field to an incorrect or unexpected value. This would likely exploit the vulnerability by misleading the decompression routine, potentially causing it to either under-allocate or over-allocate memory, or attempt to access memory that has not been allocated or has been prematurely freed.

The `u_len` field, according to the explanation for invoking CVE-2018-11496, likely denotes the length of uncompressed data for a given block in the LRZ file, suggesting an incorrect value here could manipulate the application's memory handling, leading to a use-after-free scenario.

Given the minimal LRZ file:

```
4c52 5a49 0006 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000
0000 0000 0000 0000 0101 0003 0000 0803
0000 1303 0707 0000 0000 0000 0000
```

Adjust the `u_len` (here hypothetically the 2 bytes following the pattern `0803`) to an excessively large value to attempt to trigger the vulnerability by causing an unexpected memory access. Since this field likely influences how memory is allocated or handled, setting it to a large value might cause the software to allocate more memory than intended or access memory incorrectly.

Modifying the `08 03` (which is `0x0308` in little-endian, meaning `776` in decimal) to an abnormally large value, let's use `FF FF` (which would be `65535` in decimal):

```
4c52 5a49 0006 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000
0000 0000 0000 0000 0101 0003 FF FF 1303
0707 0000 0000 0000 0000
```

Manipulating software in this manner without permission is unethical and against the law in many jurisdictions. Always conduct security testing and research responsibly and within legal boundaries.
