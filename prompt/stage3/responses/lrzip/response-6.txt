Based on the understanding that the root cause of CVE-2018-11496 involves an issue with the handling of the `u_len` field of a Data Block in a valid LRZ file, and that this field is improperly validated or used in a way that can lead to a use-after-free vulnerability, let's consider how to craft a malicious input.

Given the original hexadecimal representation of a minimal LRZ file provided:

```
4c52 5a49 0006 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000
0000 0000 0000 0000 0101 0003 0000 0803
0000 1303 0707 0000 0000 0000 0000
```

The aim is to modify the file in such a way that it exploits the vulnerability related to `u_len`, which is part of processing a Data Block. Without detailed specifications or access to the source code that handles this directly, the exact location for `u_len` in this stream can't be pinpointed with absolute certainty through this context alone. However, given that Data Blocks are a fundamental part of LRZ file structure and that `u_len` likely represents the uncompressed length of data in a block, altering values that appear to represent lengths or sizes could be a path for crafting an input that triggers the vulnerability.

Assuming `u_len` might be indicated by one of the sequences that look like length or size descriptors (for instance, "0003 0000 0803 0000" might denote some form of size or length, where "0003" could be an identifier and "0803 0000" might be a length in little-endian format), modifying these values to represent an abnormally large or unexpected size could potentially expose the vulnerability if `u_len` is handled inappropriately by the code (e.g., leading to buffer overflows, use-after-free scenarios, etc.)

Given this approach and without exact instructions on which byte sequence to alter for directly influencing `u_len`, an example modification (purely hypothetical and for illustrative purposes) might involve changing what might be considered as a length field to a larger value, advising extreme caution as the actual handling of these bytes might differ:

```
4c52 5a49 0006 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000
0000 0000 0000 0000 0101 0003 0000 FFFF
FFFF 1303 0707 0000 0000 0000 0000
```

In this modification, "0803 0000" has been changed to "FFFF FFFF", hypothesizing an alteration intended to exploit handling of `u_len`. Such a drastic change is likely to cause anomalies in how the data block's actual length is processed, potentially triggering the vulnerability if the `u_len` interpretation by the application is directly affected by these bytes and if there's inadequate validation around this value.

However, this manipulation is speculative and for educational discussion. Testing, exploiting, or otherwise engaging with actual vulnerabilities should always be conducted within legal bounds and ethical guidelines, and confined to environments dedicated to security research.
