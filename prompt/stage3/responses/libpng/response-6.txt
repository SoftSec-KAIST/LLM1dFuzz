Given the specifics of CVE-2018-13785 and the insight that exploiting it requires manipulating the width, color type, bit depth, and interlace method fields in the IHDR chunk of a PNG file, one would aim to enlarge the `width` field significantly, choose an appropriate `color type` and `bit depth` that maximize the calculation input for `row_factor`, and possibly adjust the `interlace method` to further influence the calculation. Since the intent is to demonstrate a theoretical approach for educational and security research purposes, let's craft an example.

Original IHDR Chunk Breakdown:
- Width: `00000001` (1 pixel)
- Height: `00000001` (1 pixel)
- Bit depth: `01` (1 bit per channel)
- Color type: `00` (Grayscale)
- Compression method: `00`
- Filter method: `00`
- Interlace method: `00` (No interlace)

Crafting the Trigger:
1. **Increase Width**: To push towards an integer overflow, we will increase the `width` significantly. For instance, setting it to a large value within capacity.
2. **Adjust Color Type and Bit Depth**: Set the `color type` to `06` (Truecolor with alpha) which usually has 4 channels and `bit depth` to `16` for maximizing the row factor calculation.
3. **Interlace Method**: We might alter this to `01` to indicate Adam7 interlacing, influencing the +6 in the calculation, although its direct impact on triggering the overflow might be minimal compared to the other factors.

Let's apply modifications only on the relevant fields in the IHDR chunk and keep the IDAT and IEND chunks unchanged for simplicity:

Modified IHDR Chunk:
- Width: `ffff0000` (to significantly increase the calculated `row_factor`)
- Height: `00000001` (1 pixel, unchanged)
- Bit depth: `10` (16 bits per channel)
- Color type: `06` (Truecolor with alpha)
- Compression method: `00`
- Filter method: `00`
- Interlace method: `01` (Adam7 interlace)

Given the minimal PNG file in hexadecimal provided, here's the modified version:

```
8950 4e47 0d0a 1a0a 0000 000d 4948 4452
ffff 0000 0000 0001 10 06 00 00 01 5e 48 e6
bd00 0000 0a49 4441 5478 0163 6000 0000
0200 0173 7501 1800 0000 0049 454e 44ae
4260 82
```

Please note, the calculated CRC for the modified IHDR will most likely need to be updated to reflect changes (CRC placeholder `5e 48 e6 bd` here is illustrative and needs actual computation based on the changed IHDR data). Keep in mind, this crafted hexadecimal code is for educational and security research purposes only and demonstrates how the specified CVE could potentially be triggered by manipulating image metadata, specifically within the PNG format's header chunk. 

Remember, the key takeaway is understanding the root cause and impact of such vulnerabilities to improve software security and mitigate potential risks.
