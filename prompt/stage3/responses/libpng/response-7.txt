Given the explanation of CVE-2018-13785 and understanding that it involves an overflow and potentially a divide-by-zero error based on the calculation involving the PNG file's width, channels, bit depth, and interlaced properties, we can attempt to craft a PNG image that would trigger the vulnerability. The goal here will be to modify values related to these fieldsâ€”specifically, the image width in the IHDR chunk to create conditions for an integer overflow.

Please note, crafting a file to exploit vulnerabilities should only be done within the bounds of lawful, ethical environments for security research or testing purposes.

In the minimal PNG hex data provided, the IHDR chunk (which defines the image properties) is as follows:

```
4948 4452 // IHDR chunk type
0000 0001 // width: 1
0000 0001 // height: 1
01       // bit depth
00       // color type
0000 0037 // CRC
```

To potentially trigger the CVE, we need to greatly increase the width and ensure that the PNG is considered valid by manipulating other values accordingly. We'll set a very large width:

```
0000 FFFF // example width: 65535
```

So, modifying the PNG with a very large width, assuming the height as 1, bit depth as 1, and keeping it non-interlaced for simplicity:

New IHDR (hex data reflecting a width of 65535, height of 1):

```
8950 4E47 0D0A 1A0A 0000 000D 4948 4452 
0000 FFFF 0000 0001 0100 0000 0037 6EF9 
24
```

It's important to adjust or calculate the CRC correctly when changing any part of a PNG file; however, for simplicity and focusing on the concept of triggering the CVE, the CRC has been left as in the original example. In a real-world security research context, you'd use a tool or write a script to correctly calculate the CRC for the modified IHDR chunk.


**Full modified PNG hex data:**

```
8950 4E47 0D0A 1A0A 0000 000D 4948 4452 
0000 FFFF 0000 0001 0100 0000 0037 6EF9 
2400 0000 0A49 4441 5478 0163 6000 0000 
0200 0173 7501 1800 0000 0049 454E 44AE 
4260 82
```

Please, implement and assess such changes with extreme caution, ensuring all activities are ethical, legal, and within the bounds of permissioned environments. Misuse of crafted files to exploit vulnerabilities can be illegal and unethical.
