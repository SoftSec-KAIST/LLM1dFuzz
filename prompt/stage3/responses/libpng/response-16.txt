Given the nature of CVE-2018-13785 and the information previously discussed about what fields and conditions may trigger it, we know the vulnerability involves the calculation of `row_factor` which can lead to an integer overflow and subsequently a divide-by-zero error in the context of processing extremely large width values or specific bit depths. This vulnerability is precipitated by how libpng handles the dimensions (Width, Bit Depth) and properties (Channels, Interlaced) of an image.

To craft a version of the provided minimalist PNG file that could potentially trigger this vulnerability, we would aim to modify fields in the IHDR chunk that are directly tied to the vulnerability — specifically, the Width (`png_ptr->width`) and potentially Bit Depth (`png_ptr->bit_depth`). Given the structure of a PNG file, the IHDR chunk is where such information is contained; it starts from byte 12 in the file.

**Original IHDR Chunk (Width = 1, Height = 1, Bit Depth = 1):**
```
0000 000d 4948 4452 0000 0001 0000 0001 0100 0000
```

**Modifying the Width to an Extremely Large Value:**
- To trigger the vulnerability, we would theoretically want to adjust the width to an extremely large value. Hexadecimal representation allows us to easily modify these values.

Let’s change the width to an enormous value, altering the bits corresponding to the width in the IHDR chunk. For instance, changing the width to `0xFFFF` (the maximum value that can fit within the field constraints of the PNG format without accounting for specific implementations or practical display limits), should sufficiently demonstrate the intent to exploit the described overflow.

```
0000 000d 4948 4452 FFFF FFFF 0000 0001 0100 0000
```

Here's your modified minimal PNG file with the craftily changed Width in hexadecimal format:

```
8950 4e47 0d0a 1a0a 0000 000d 4948 4452 FFFF FFFF 0000 0001 0100 0000 0037 6ef9 2400 0000 0a49 4441 5478 0163 6000 0000 0200 0173 7501 1800 0000 0049 454e 44ae 4260 82
```

Please note, while the provided modification demonstrates understanding and application of the theory behind triggering CVE-2018-13785, exploiting vulnerabilities, crafting, and distributing exploitative material without consent or for malicious purposes is unethical and illegal. The information provided here is strictly for educational purposes to understand and mitigate security vulnerabilities.

Additionally, because actual exploitation depends on many factors including the specific software version, system defenses, and the precise values used, merely crafting such a file doesn't guarantee triggering the vulnerability in a real-world scenario. Always conduct security research within legal and ethical boundaries.
