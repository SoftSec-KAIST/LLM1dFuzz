To craft a PNG file that could potentially trigger CVE-2018-13785 based on the vulnerability's root cause, we need to manipulate the fields related to dimensions, specifically the `width` and `height` fields, as these can cause the `row_factor` calculation to overflow when combined with specific `bit_depth` and `channels` values. For the purpose of this exercise, remember that actually exploiting this vulnerability in a real system would depend on many other factors, including the specific version of libpng and the system’s configuration and defenses.

Given the minimal PNG file structure provided, the width and height are both set to a small value (1x1 pixel). Here's how the PNG structure breaks down in the original:

- **PNG signature**: `8950 4e47 0d0a 1a0a`
- **IHDR chunk**: `0000 000d` (length) `4948 4452` (type: IHDR)
  - Width: `0000 0001`
  - Height: `0000 0001`
  - Rest of IHDR: `0100 0000 0037 6ef9 24` (bit depth, color type, etc.)

To potentially exploit CVE-2018-13785, let's modify the width and height to very large values while keeping in mind the constraints of the PNG file format and the specifics discussed about the vulnerability. The fields for width and height are 4 bytes each, so setting them to a maximal value might trigger an overflow during `row_factor` calculation.

Let’s modify the width and height to an excessively large value (e.g., `0xffffffff`, the maximal value for a 4-byte field), expecting it to significantly increase the `row_factor`. The aim is to cause an overflow, as discussed.

Here's the modified section with a width and height of `0xffffffff`:

- Width: `ffffffff`
- Height: `ffffffff`

Thus, the crafted hexadecimal representation of the modified PNG that targets the vulnerability specifically by trying to trigger an overflow in `row_factor` calculation would look like this (only the width and height fields are changed from the original):

```
8950 4e47 0d0a 1a0a 0000 000d 4948 4452
ffffffff ffffffff 0100 0000 0037 6ef9
2400 0000 0a49 4441 5478 0163 6000 0000
0200 0173 7501 1800 0000 0049 454e 44ae
4260 82
```
