To attempt to trigger the vulnerability CVE-2018-13785 based on the provided information, one would need to craft a PNG file with values in the IHDR chunk (specifically, width, height, bit depth, and color type) and possibly other relevant fields to exploit the incorrect calculation of `row_factor` that could lead to an integer overflow and a divide-by-zero issue in versions of libpng prior to the patch.

Given the constraints outlined and without intentions to create a malicious file, but rather to theoretically demonstrate what changes could potentially make the PNG file more likely to trigger the vulnerability for educational or security research purposes:

### Original IHDR Chunk:
- Width: 0x00000001 (1 pixel)
- Height: 0x00000001 (1 pixel)
- Bit depth and color type (assuming grayscale, non-interlaced as per given hex): 0x01 (bit depth 1) 0x00 (grayscale)

### Theoretical Modification:
- Increase `width` and `height` to large values to increase the chance of triggering an integer overflow due to the calculation logic before the patch.
- Increase `bit depth` to 16 bits (0x10) for each channel to maximize the row factor calculation.

### Example Modification:
Change the width and height to a large value (for this theoretical exercise, let's use 0xFFFFFFF, which is large but still under the unsigned 32-bit integer max to avoid immediate overflow from just the dimension values) and change the bit depth to 16 (0x10), keeping the color type as grayscale (0x00):

```
8950 4e47 0d0a 1a0a 0000 000d 4948 4452
FFFFFFF FFFFFF 10 00 0000 0037 6ef9
24 [...]
```

However, keep in mind that crafting a hexadecimal string in this manner without adjusting for the appropriate CRCs and potentially adjusting IDAT data to fit the hypothetical image's purported size and color specifications goes beyond the scope of this response and may not result in a valid or specifically vulnerability-triggering PNG file. Also, altering bit_depth directly in hexadecimal without adjusting other dependent values appropriately is speculative in theory and for educational purposes.

In practical application, an understanding of the PNG specification, including properly calculating CRCs, and potentially adjusting other parts of the file (including the IDAT chunk to represent actual image data that matches the header specifications) is necessary to create a valid PNG file.

This hypothetical change is provided for educational purposes to illustrate the type of manipulation that would be aimed at exploiting the vulnerability described; actual exploitation attempts or generating of potentially harmful files is not advised and is against ethical guidelines.
