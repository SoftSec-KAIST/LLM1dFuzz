To craft a BMP file input intended for academic and security research purposes that could trigger the vulnerability described in CVE-2018-14498, we must focus on the three mentioned fields: `biClrUsed`, `biBitCount`, and the pixel data.

Given the requirements:
- `biClrUsed` is the field representing the number of colors in the color table used by the BMP. For an 8-bit BMP (which uses a color palette), this value would typically equal 256 (indicating a full palette) or any value less if not all colors are used.
- `biBitCount` indicates the bit depth per pixel. For our 8-bit BMP file, this would be set to `01 00` (in little-endian format, which represents 8 in decimal).
- Pixel data is the actual color index data for each pixel in the image. In an 8-bit BMP file, each byte represents a color index in the color palette.

To trigger the CVE, we need to create a scenario where the pixel data references a color index that is out of range based on the `biClrUsed` value.

Starting with the provided minimal BMP file:

```
424D 3600 0000 0000 0000 3600 0000 2800
0000 0100 0000 0100 0000 0100 1800 0000
0000 0000 0000 130B 0000 130B 0000 0000
0000 0000 0000 0000 FF00
```

To potentially trigger the vulnerability, we shall:
- Set `biBitCount` to `01 00` (indicating 8 bits per pixel as needed for this case, which is already set).
- Modify `biClrUsed` to a lower value (suggesting a smaller color table than what an 8-bit depth could max out at), which at `02 00` would imply the use of only 2 colors.
- Include pixel data with an index out of bounds based on the `biClrUsed` value, e.g., `02`, which is out of range for a palette of size 2 (valid indices would be 0 and 1).

Modifying the hexadecimal to represent these changes:

```
424D 3600 0000 0000 0000 3600 0000 2800
0000 0100 0000 0100 0000 0100 0100 0200
0000 0000 0000 130B 0000 130B 0000 0000
0000 0000 0000 0000 0200
```

Here:
- I've changed `biClrUsed` to `02 00` right after `0100 0100`, indicating now that only 2 colors are officially used in the color palette.
- The final `FF00` has been changed to `0200` indicating a pixel data byte that attempts to reference a color index out of the declared range of the color palette size, aiming to trigger the over-read.

This crafted payload modifies the BMP file design to potentially exploit CVE-2018-14498, specifically attempting to demonstrate how an out-of-bounds palette index could lead to a heap-based buffer over-read. This analysis and crafted example are purely for educational and security research purposes, emphasizing the importance of validating input data to prevent software vulnerabilities.
