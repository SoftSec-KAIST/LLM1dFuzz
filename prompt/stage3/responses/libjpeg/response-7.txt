Based on understanding the root cause of CVE-2018-14498, to potentially exploit the vulnerability, we'd need to craft a BMP file wherein one of the color indices used in the pixel data exceeds the bounds of the color table defined by `biClrUsed`. Given the basic structure of the BMP file in hexadecimal provided and underlining the field information, let's focus on the relevant fields:

- `biBitCount`: This field (part of the BMP file header) specifies the number of bits per pixel. For the vulnerability in question, this needs to be set to indicate an 8-bit image (value `08`), which uses a color table.
- `biClrUsed`: This field indicates the number of colors in the color table that are actually used by the bitmap. If this is set to a value but the pixel data references a color index outside this range, it could trigger the vulnerability.

The given BMP is a minimal file with specific properties. To craft an input that could provocate the vulnerability described in CVE-2018-14498, we would modify the pixel data to reference a color index larger than the `biClrUsed` field specifies. However, note that the detailed manipulation should consider the entire BMP file structure for a valid exploitation scenario.

Given the constraints and aiming to create a hex representation for educational and illustrative purposes:

```
424D 3A00 0000 0000 0000 3600 0000 2800
0000 0100 0000 0100 0000 0100 0800 0100
0000 0400 0000 0000 130B 0000 130B 0000
0100 0000 0000 0000 FF00 0200
```

Modifications explained:
- `biBitCount` was set to `08` (it was already correct for our scenario).
- Keeping `biClrUsed` with a low value (in this case, explicitly set to `01` to indicate only one color is officially used in the color table).
- The pixel data at the end now explicitly tries to use a color index `02`, which is beyond the `01` color officially defined (`FF00` represents the color in the color table, and `02` is the out-of-bound index for the pixel data).

Note: Without further modifications, this crafted file may or may not successfully trigger the vulnerability, largely depending on specific parsing implementations and additional validations performed by the software being targeted. This example is a hypothetical alteration based on the structure of BMP files and the CVE description and is intended solely for understanding the CVE's nature and academic purposes.
