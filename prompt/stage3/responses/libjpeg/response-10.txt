Given your correction and the requirement to craft a BMP file that could potentially trigger CVE-2018-14498 by exploiting the relevant fields (`biClrUsed`, `biBitCount`, and pixel data), I understand that modifying the BMP to have a color index in the pixel data that exceeds the `biClrUsed` field should achieve this. Specifically, ensuring `biBitCount` signifies an 8-bit image, setting a specific small `biClrUsed` value (indicating a small color table), and then having pixel data index that is out-of-range based on that `biClrUsed` value should ideally trigger the vulnerability.

The provided hexadecimal represents a BMP file with the following relevant attributes:
- `biSize` (the size of the BMP header) is set to 40 bytes (28 in hex).
- `biWidth` and `biHeight` both set to 1, indicating a 1x1 pixel image.
- `biBitCount` is set to 24 (18 in hex), indicating a 24-bit color depth.

To attempt triggering CVE-2018-14498, the BMP needs to be an 8-bit image (not 24-bit), with `biClrUsed` indicating fewer colors in the palette than what the pixel data attempts to index. Let's modify the file accordingly:
- Change `biBitCount` to 08 (indicating an 8-bit image).
- Keep `biClrUsed` at 00000000, which typically implies using all possible colors for the bit depth; instead, we'll explicitly set it to a low number (e.g., 1) to define a small color table intentionally.
- Add a pixel index (in the pixel data part) that exceeds the specified number of colors in the palette. Given we'll set `biClrUsed` to 1, any value above 0 would be out-of-range.

Considering the above, and modifying the provided BMP file:
- Keep the BMP header and DIB header portions unchanged until `biBitCount`.
- Change `biBitCount` to 08
- Explicitly set `biClrUsed` to 01, indicating we're using just 1 color in the palette.
- The palette will follow, and since `biClrUsed` is 1, we need only one 4-byte entry for the color table.
- Finally, ensure the pixel data tries to access a palette index that doesn't exist (e.g., 01, since we only have index 0 available).

Modified BMP in hexadecimal (with comments for clarity):
```
424D 3A00 0000 0000 0000 3A00 0000 2800 // BMP header up to `biSize`
0000 0100 0000 0100 0000 0100 0800 0000 // Width, Height, Planes, BitCount(8-bit)
0000 0000 0000 0200 0000 130B 0000 130B // Compression, ImageSize(bigger due to color table), X&Y pixels per meter
0000 0100 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 FF00 // biClrUsed(1), biClrImportant, beginning of color table,
                                        // and the color for palette index 0 (blue, here for example)
01                                       // Pixel data index (intentionally out-of-range)
```

Note: This construction intentionally sets `biClrUsed` to 1 to have a color table with a single entry. Then, the pixel data part tries to use an index (01) which is out-of-range, potentially triggering the vulnerability described in CVE-2018-14498. Keep in mind that actual exploitation would depend on the affected software's handling of such malformed BMP files and the software version (must be before the patch for CVE-2018-14498). This example is purely for educational and security research purposes.
