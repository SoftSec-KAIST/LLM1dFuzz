Understanding the structure of the BMP file and the root cause of CVE-2018-14498, we can craft an input to possibly trigger the vulnerability by manipulating the `biClrUsed` field and the pixel data in a way that a color index refers to an out-of-range entry in the color palette. Based on the original file provided, let's analyze the relevant sections:

- `biClrUsed`: This field specifies the number of colors in the color palette and is located at the offset 0x002E (46 in decimal) from the file start in the `BITMAPINFOHEADER`. The original value appears to be `01 00 00 00`, indicating that only 1 color is used by the bitmap.
- `biBitCount`: This field represents the number of bits per pixel and is located at the offset 0x001C (28 in decimal) from the file start, within the `BITMAPINFOHEADER`. The original value is `01 00`, indicating a 1-bit per pixel bitmap, which is not aligned with an 8-bit per pixel bitmap required to exploit this CVE.
- Pixel Data: The actual bitmap data that uses the color indices to reference colors in the color palette. To exploit the vulnerability, we would need to introduce a pixel data byte that references a color index beyond what is available in the palette defined by `biClrUsed`.

To trigger the CVE, we must:

1. Change `biBitCount` to `08 00` to make it an 8-bit per pixel BMP, allowing for the use of a color palette.
2. Set `biClrUsed` to indicate a small number of colors in the palette, e.g., `01 00 00 00` (indicating 1 color) can be left unchanged to simplify.
3. Ensure the pixel data contains an index that is out of the range of the defined palette. Since `biClrUsed` is `1`, any index greater than `0` would be out of range.

Given the minimal changes needed:

```
424D 3600 0000 0000 0000 3600 0000 2800
0000 0100 0000 0100 0000 0100 0800 0000
0000 0000 0000 130B 0000 130B 0000 0000
0000 0000 0000 0001 FF00
```

Modifications:
- Changed the `biBitCount` to `08 00` (from `18 00` to `08 00` by mistake in our plain text, but as per initial intention to set 8-bit bitmap).
- The final pixel value `FF00` remains as it is which in the context of 1-bit would not be suitable. For an 8-bit image scenario to demonstrate the overflow, the palette size (1 entry) and an index in the pixel data exceeding this would be required. However, as per the initial hex provided and requirements for the exploit, one would consider 'FF' or another exceeding value as the pixel data within the context of their palette size already being too small. Yet, considering `biClrUsed` and the spec, our manipulations should focus on the bitmap data at the end.

Correcting for a clearer example based on understanding but without further hexadecimal string provided for exact exploit crafting:
- We note a confusion in modifying bit depth directly in hex representation without adjusting the payload and misunderstandings from the initial explanation on bit depth modification. Crafting of an exploit specifically in hexadecimal depends significantly on correctly sized values for `biClrUsed`, actual `biBitCount`, and ensuring pixel data which would exceed the palette entries as stated, which needs actual manipulation in the bitmap data area, not just header fields, with correctness towards intended palette use and bitmap data meant to exceed the defined `biClrUsed`.

Considering we adapt towards the expectation of seeing an index out-of-bounds given `biClrUsed`, ensure:
- Binary is truly set as 8-bit per pixel.
- Pixel data (following the DIB header and palette) uses indices over the provided palette size.

Given the construct and explanation around BMP crafting and bit depth, the actual crafting for malicious intent requires precise adaptation of pixel data as well exceeding the palette defined by `biClrUsed`â€”a crucial element in explaining susceptibility in context but omitted correctly modeled exploitation code.
