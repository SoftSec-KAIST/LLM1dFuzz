To potentially trigger the vulnerability related to CVE-2018-14498 based on the need for a BMP file that has a color index exceeding its color table length, we need to carefully adjust the `biClrUsed`, `biBitCount`, and pixel data fields in the minimal BMP file provided.

Given BMP structure in hexadecimal representation:

```
424D 3600 0000 0000 0000 3600 0000 2800
0000 0100 0000 0100 0000 0100 1800 0000
0000 0000 0000 130B 0000 130B 0000 0000
0000 0000 0000 0000 FF00
```

### 1. Understanding Key Fields

- `biBitCount` indicates the color depth. In the given BMP, it's set to `0100` in hexadecimal which denotes 1 bit per pixel in little-endian format. For an 8-bit BMP that maps to a color table (palette), this value should be `08 00`.
  
- `biClrUsed` specifies the number of colors used by the BMP from the color table. In this BMP, it is not explicitly set (defaults to 0 implying full usage of the table based on `biBitCount`). For this example, we'll set it to `01 00 00 00` to indicate only 1 color used explicitly, allowing us to then force an out-of-range color index by referencing a color index not covered by this.

- Pixel data for 1x1 8-bit BMP starts after the header + DIB header. Given the file structure, we need to ensure the pixel data (color index) points to a color index exceeding the indicated `biClrUsed`. Since `biClrUsed` is 1, any value above 0 should theoretically trigger the vulnerability (e.g., `01` to reference the second color entry not present).

### 2. Modifications

1. Change `biBitCount` to `08 00` to indicate 8-bit color depth.
2. Set `biClrUsed` to `01 00 00 00`, meaning the color table contains 1 color.
3. Modify pixel data to reference a color index that exceeds the color table length set by `biClrUsed`. With just 1 color in the color table, index `01` would be out-of-bounds.

### 3. Resulting Hexadecimal Representation

```
424D 3600 0000 0000 0000 3600 0000 2800
0000 0100 0000 0100 0000 0800 0100 0000
0000 0000 0000 130B 0000 130B 0000 0100
0000 0000 0000 FF00 0000 01
```

Changes are:
- Set `biBitCount` to `08` after `0100 0000 0100 0000`.
- Adjusted `biClrUsed` to `01 00 00 00` right after `0800 0100`.
- Color table `FF00 00` (red component only) followed by a pixel data value `01` indicating use of a color index out of range. Assuming the header size remains the same, leading zeroes may need to adjust to ensure file integrity and proper alignment depending on implementation specifics of reading these files.

Remember, this example can theoretically trigger the vulnerability by referencing a color index out of range, but in practice, the reaction of software will depend on how it manages memory and error conditions introduced by such malformed BMP files.
