Understanding the CVE's root cause and the relevant fields (biClrUsed, biBitCount, and pixel data), crafting a BMP file to potentially trigger the vulnerability involves creating a situation where a pixel's color index is out of bounds for the number of colors defined in the color palette. To achieve this in an 8-bit BMP (where `biBitCount`=8), the `biClrUsed` field can be manipulated to define a small color palette, and pixel data can then reference a color index outside this defined range.

Given the provided BMP file in hexadecimal, let's first understand the structure:

- The `biSize` field starting at offset 0x0E tells us the size of the BITMAPINFOHEADER structure, which is 28 bytes (0x28 in hex).
- Following this, the `biWidth` and `biHeight` fields are both set to 1 (indicating a 1x1 pixel bitmap).
- The `biBitCount` field is set to 18 (0x18 in hex), which incorrectly indicates 24 bits per pixel. For an 8-bit BMP (necessary to target this CVE), `biBitCount` should be set to 08.
- `biClrUsed` is not explicitly set in the provided BMP. For this illustration, we will modify this value to have a limited palette size.

To craft an input that could trigger the vulnerability, the changes will include setting `biBitCount` to 8 (to work with an 8-bit per pixel BMP file), defining `biClrUsed` to imply a small palette (for instance, 1 color), and ensuring pixel data references a color index outside this range.

Below is a modification to the original hexadecimal input:

```
424D 3A00 0000 0000 0000 3600 0000 2800
0000 0100 0000 0100 0000 0100 0800 0100
0000 0400 0000 130B 0000 130B 0000 0100
0000 0000 0000 FF00 0000 FF02
```

Notes on the modifications:
- `biBitCount` is changed to `08` (from `18`), located at the offset for `biBitCount`, to indicate an 8-bit bitmap.
- `biClrUsed` is set to `01` (1 color in the palette), positioned immediately after `biCompression`. This indicates only 1 color is used in the color palette.
- `0000 0000 FF00 0000` defines a single entry in the color palette.
- The pixel data has been adjusted to `FF02` to represent an index referencing outside the defined color palette (given that `biClrUsed` indicated only 1 entry, this `02` index is invalid/out of range).

This crafted file, by having a pixel data index (`FF02`) that goes beyond the single defined palette entry (`biClrUsed` = `01`), would aim to exploit the CVE-2018-14498 vulnerability by forcing the software to read beyond the bounds of the allocated color palette array. This description and the crafted BMP are hypothetical examples to illustrate how the vulnerability might be triggered based on the CVE details provided and the fields relevant to BMP file structure.
