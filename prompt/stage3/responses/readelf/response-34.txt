Based on the detailed information provided about CVE-2017-16828 and the understanding that it involves the augmentation data length field of an FDE in any debug frame section's CFI record in a valid ELF file, we can craft a modification to trigger the vulnerability. 

The goal is to manipulate the augmentation data length field in a way that, when added to the current reading position (start), it would cause an integer overflow or lead to a scenario where 'start + augmentation_data_len' is incorrectly calculated due to an excessively large augmentation data length. This incorrect calculation could then allow bypassing the check for 'start >= end', potentially causing a buffer over-read.

Given the original ELF file in hexadecimal, without the specific location of an FDE and its augmentation data length readily identified in your hex dump, and considering the explanation's context, a hypothetical modification would involve identifying an augmentation data length field and altering it to be unexpectedly large.

However, without directly parsing and pointing out the specific offset for the FDE and its augmentation length within your provided bytes, here's a conceptual approach on what the modification might look like, focusing on altering a length field:

- **Step 1**: Locate the section containing the FDE. In reality, this requires parsing the ELF structure, identifying the `.debug_frame` section (or equivalent containing the CFI records), and finding an FDE within it.

- **Step 2**: Identify the augmentation data length field within an FDE. This length field directly precedes the augmentation data and is typically encoded in a variable-length format (ULEB128 in DWARF).

- **Step 3**: Modify the augmentation data length to a large value that, when processed, would demonstrate the overflow behavior. This modification must be plausible within the format's representation and the specific binary's structure.

Given these steps and focusing purely on the educational aspect of understanding such vulnerabilities, suppose we hypothetically decided to modify a length at some offset to demonstrate overflow. Since directly pinpointing and altering a specific relevant length within the provided hex string without precise offsets is speculative and for genuine modification requires detailed ELF and DWARF parsing and understanding, hereâ€™s a hypothetical alteration:

Let's assume at some offset, there's an augmentation length field. In reality, changing this to a large value might look like changing a sequence of `00 00` (representing some original small length) to `FF FF FF FF` (a crafted value intended to cause an overflow or other unintended behavior when added to the 'start').

**Note**: The above explanation is conceptual, aiming to demonstrate understanding of the vulnerability and its exploitation based on a generic representation. Actual exploitation requires precise, detailed knowledge of the ELF layout, the location of the debug information, and the structure of CFI records within it, which goes beyond the scope of simple hexadecimal modification without specific offsets and lengths. Always ensure research and demonstration of vulnerabilities are conducted ethically and within legal boundaries.
