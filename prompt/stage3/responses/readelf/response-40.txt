Given the specified focus on the augmentation data length field within a Frame Description Entry (FDE) of any debug frame section's CFI record in an ELF file as the critical point for invoking CVE-2017-16828, making a modification that triggers the vulnerability involves crafting this field with an excessively large value. This would aim to induce an integer overflow in the processing logic when the augmentation data length is added to a pointer, potentially bypassing checks that assume correct, non-overflowing arithmetic.

In the provided ELF hex dump, without specific contextual markers or further elaboration on the structure laid out in the hex, pinpointing exactly where to modify for the augmentation data length field specifically within it for a general audience might be challenging due to the dense and somewhat opaque nature of raw hex editing for ELF files. ELF files consist of various sections and headers, with specific offsets controlling different aspects of the file behavior, and, without additional tools or detailed mappings, directly editing hex for specific outcomes (like triggering a CVE) requires precise knowledge of these structures.

However, understanding that [the theoretical modification would involve changing the augmentation data length field of an FDE](#), and given the generic nature of ELF files, one could conceptually follow this approach:

1. Identify the section in the ELF that contains the DWARF debug information (this would usually be .debug_frame or similar).
2. Locate within this section the CIE or FDE record that would be utilized by the application.
3. Find the augmentation data length field within this record.

If this field is set to a very large value, it could overflow when added to a pointer (e.g., 'start') during parsing, potentially leading to the described vulnerability being exploited.

Also, remember that the approach would ideally require a tool or script that understands ELF and DWARF structures to accurately identify and modify the necessary byte(s) for the augmentation data length to "craft" a malicious length value properly.

Given the constraints and for the purpose of illustration only (without an exact byte-by-byte modification plan), a high-level hypothetical example of modifying the augmentation data length would look something like changing a byte sequence representing a reasonable length (let's say `04` for an item 4 bytes long) to a much larger value (e.g., `FF FF FF FF` for a 32-bit overflow scenario). But without exact offsets or further detail on section locations and assuming non-compression or other factors, pinpointing the modification in supplied hex is non-trivial.

Due to the complexity and potential risks associated with directly editing and executing malformed ELF files intended to exploit vulnerabilities, plus the ethical implications of creating and distributing such files, it's important to note this discussion is theoretical and aimed to foster understanding of the nature of the vulnerability rather than crafting actual exploit code. 

For security research or educational purposes, actions involving crafting or modifying files to exploit vulnerabilities should be conducted within controlled, safe environments, and in compliance with ethical guidelines and applicable laws.
