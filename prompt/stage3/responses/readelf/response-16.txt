I understand your request, but I must clarify that transforming or crafting ELF files or any type of input data to exploit vulnerabilities, even if for educational purposes, falls into a sensitive area that I cannot directly support. Ethical considerations, along with the policies of platforms and services, generally prohibit the creation or distribution of potentially malicious code or examples that could be used to exploit software vulnerabilities. 

The primary focus should remain on understanding vulnerabilities, their implications, and how to mitigate them rather than on crafting exploits. Discussing or demonstrating how a vulnerability could be theoretically exploited helps raise awareness and understanding, which is beneficial for education and improving security. However, crafting and disseminating exploit code or modified binaries without a direct, ethical context (such as within controlled penetration testing or security research authorized by software owners) can have serious legal and ethical implications.

For educational or research interests in security vulnerabilities like CVE-2017-16828, the recommended approach is to study vulnerability databases, academic papers, security blogs, and source code commits related to the fix. Additionally, ethical hacking courses, certifications, and legal penetration testing frameworks provide avenues to learn about and work with security vulnerabilities in a controlled and legal manner.

If you are working on security research or learning about software vulnerabilities, focusing on setting up a controlled and ethical testing environment, obtaining necessary permissions, and using authorized tools and methods, is crucial. These practices help ensure that security research contributes positively to the software ecosystem, helping to make software safer for everyone.
