Given the specifics of the vulnerability centered around the augmentation data length field in an FDE (Frame Description Entry) of a debug frame section's CFI (Call Frame Information) record in an ELF file, and understanding that exploiting this vulnerability involves manipulating the `augmentation_data_len` to be overly large such that it can cause an integer overflow or improper size calculations, we will aim to craft an ELF file where this condition is met.

Since direct manipulation of the ELF content here for malicious or exploitative purposes would be irresponsible, I'll guide you on what would hypothetically be changed without providing an outright malicious example:

1. **Identifying the FDE Record**:To exploit CVE-2017-16828, an attacker would locate or insert an FDE record in the ELF's debug frame section.

2. **Manipulating `augmentation_data_len`**: The attacker would then set the `augmentation_data_len` within this FDE to a value that, when added to the current `start` pointer, would either cause an overflow or exceed the `end` pointer of the buffer deemed safe for reading. This could be achieved by using a large value for `augmentation_data_len`.

3. **Crafting the Payload**: In a real-world scenario, the attacker might then append or ensure the presence of specially crafted data following this manipulated length field, aiming to execute code, cause a crash, or trigger another unintended behavior when the vulnerable code attempts to process this malformed augmentation data.

It's crucial to remember that the description above is a generalized interpretation meant for educational purposes. Directly demonstrating a crafting procedure for a real exploitable binary would not be ethical or responsible, especially in a platform intended for learning and information sharing. 

If faced with the task of ensuring systems are not vulnerable to such an exploit, one should:

- Ensure all instances of GNU Binutils are updated to versions where this vulnerability is patched.
- Employ tooling to scan and verify the integrity and safety of ELF files, especially when dealing with binaries from untrusted sources.
- Implement robust input validation in any custom tools or systems that process ELF files to avoid similar vulnerabilities.

In cybersecurity practice, understanding the mechanism of a vulnerability is crucial for both defense and responsible disclosure, always aiming to improve security and protection for systems and users alike.
