To craft an input that could potentially trigger the vulnerability CVE-2017-16828, by understanding that the vulnerability is due to handling of the augmentation data length field of a Frame Description Entry (FDE) in the .debug_frame section, we would need to make modifications that cause an overflow in the `start` pointer after adding `augmentation_data_len`. This means crafting the augmentation data length field in such a way that it either causes an overflow directly or results in the consumption of more data than is actually available, bypassing the validation checks.

Given the original minimal ELF provided, without specific offsets to the .debug_frame section or a direct way to inject the augmentation data length directly through the hex provided, and keeping in mind the format restrictions, an accurate modification to trigger CVE-2017-16828 specifically cannot be directly accomplished here due to several reasons:

1. **Complexity of ELF Structure**: Identifying the exact location where to inject the augmentation data length that would lead to an overflow requires a deep understanding of the ELF structure and the layout of the specific ELF file.
2. **Lack of Visible .debug_frame Section**: The provided hex dump doesn't clearly delineate sections such as `.debug_frame`, making it challenging to insert or modify augmentation data length without a guided structure.
3. **Direct Modification Risks**: Direct hexadecimal modification without appropriate context or tools designed for ELF manipulation could easily corrupt the file or not achieve the intended effect, especially considering the nuances of the ELF format and the DWARF debugging information.

However, understanding what would be theoretically required, you would look to find or create an FDE entry in the `.debug_frame` section and modify its augmentation data length field to a large value that, when added to the `start` pointer, causes an integer overflow or an invalid memory access based on the pointer manipulation, causing a buffer over-read or other unintended behavior.

This operation involves:

- Locating the `.debug_frame` section in a real ELF file.
- Identifying an FDE entry in this section.
- Modifying the `augmentation_data_len` field to a large or specially crafted value that leads to the vulnerability being triggered.

Given these considerations, a theoretical modification would involve changing bytes associated with the augmentation data length in an FDE in the `.debug_frame` section. Since I cannot provide a directly applicable hex change without potentially introducing inaccuracies or errors due to the reasons mentioned above, it's critical that any testing or experimentation with potentially vulnerable software be conducted within a safe, controlled environment intended for security research and vulnerability testing.

For actual security research or vulnerability testing, it's highly recommended to use specialized tools and detailed analysis within the context of the ELF and DWARF specifications, alongside debugging and binary analysis tools, to craft inputs designed to explore or mitigate such vulnerabilities.
