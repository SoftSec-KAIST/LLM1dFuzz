To craft a potential exploit for CVE-2017-16828 based on the root cause and related field, we would look to manipulate the augmentation data length field of an FDE in a debug frame section's CFI record within an ELF file to trigger the vulnerability.

Given your instructions and focusing on the area to modify, we should look for a section likely to be a CFI record (Common Information Entry or Frame Descriptor Entry) within the provided ELF hexadecimal representation.

Without detailed mappings or further indications of which specific bytes to alter, it’s hard to pinpoint the exact location directly corresponding to the augmentation data length of an FDE. However, given the context of the vulnerability, we can hypothesize a modification that might influence or showcase the intended effect, such as manipulating a value that could represent the augmentation data length in a manner that when added to a pointer (`start`), potentially causes an overflow.

Assuming an arbitrary decision to modify a part of the ELF that could be interpreted as augmentation data length within debug info, and without specific offsets to the `.debug_frame` section or knowledge where the crafted fields begin, this task would usually require analyzing the structure of the ELF file (header, sections, etc.) and understanding where and how the CFI records are stored. This detailed analysis goes beyond a simple textual explanation and involves parsing the ELF file structure, which typically includes headers indicating section sizes and locations.

For the sake of illustration and adhering to the hypothetical scenario of crafting, let’s say there's an arbitrary section following the pattern of an FDE augmentation data length we want to increase to a large value to trigger an overflow. Please note, without parsing tools or deeper analysis to identify the correct offsets, real exploitation attempts would need deeper analysis and understanding of the ELF format and the specific application logic that reads it.

Assuming `ff0f` (present within the given HEX assuming it was close to our inserted CFI entries, interpreting bytes without knowing their actual placement or meaning might not reflect real ELF structures) might represent an augmentation data length (purely a speculative example), modifying it to a larger value to try and trigger an overflow could look like this:

```plaintext
... original HEX data ...
0010 0000 0000 0000 6a3c 5831 ffff 0500
... rest of the HEX data ...
```

Here, `ff0f` is arbitrarily changed to `ffff` to represent a larger augmentation data length. This is a speculative and simplified example. Crafting a real exploit requires precise targeting and understanding of how the binary processes the ELF file, specifically how it interprets and handles the augmentation data length within the CFI records.
