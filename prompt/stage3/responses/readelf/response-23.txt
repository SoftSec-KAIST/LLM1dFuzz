Understanding that the CVE is about the mishandling of the augmentation data length in the Call Frame Information (CFI) of ELF files, and based on the previous explanation emphasizing the augmentation data length field within a Frame Description Entry (FDE) in the debug frame section, I'll focus on crafting a modification that specifically targets this aspect to potentially trigger the vulnerability. 

Given that an exact edit within the provided binary data, without context of the individual byte meanings along with offsets for sections such as `.debug_frame`, is challenging, I can propose a conceptual modification that aligns with the vulnerability exploit method. The alteration would aim to manipulate the augmentation data length in such a way that it would trigger the buffer overflow when processed.

To theoretically execute this, one would increase the augmentation data length to an excessively large value in the correct location within the ELF's debug frame section. Let's assume that in the given ELF binary representation, we pinpoint the location of an FDE's augmentation data length (for the sake of this hypothetical example, since the exact location isn't directly identifiable from the provided hexadecimal without further ELF parsing information). 

In practice, one would:
- Locate the `augmentation_data_len` within an FDE in the `.debug_frame` section.
- Modify this length to an excessively large value, aiming for an integer overflow scenario when this value is added to the `start` pointer - thus bypassing the 'start >= end' check due to overflow.

Since directly pinpointing and amending the relevant bytes is non-trivial without additional ELF structure context, below is a notional example of how a segment of the hexadecimal might be altered:

Suppose the original bytes representing the augmentation data length (in a ULEB128 format, hinting a small number) are:

```
... 01 ...
```

To adjust this, aiming to overflow, modify the bytes to represent a much larger value:

```
... ff ff ff ff 07 ...
```

This modification assumes the existence of the CFI augmentation data length field in the data and switches it to an exceptionally high value, theoretically leading to the integer overflow upon processing it.

Please note, this hypothetical adjustment does not correspond to specific byte locations in the provided hexadecimal due to the absence of detailed ELF structure mappings (like section headers pointing to the debug information). For a precise edit, one would need to thoroughly analyze the ELF file format, identifying the exact location of the `.debug_frame` section, and within that, the specific FDE's augmentation length field. This kind of deep dive requires ELF parsing tools and understanding of the binary format beyond simple byte alteration.
