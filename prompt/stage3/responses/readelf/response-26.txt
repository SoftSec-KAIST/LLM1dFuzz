Given the information and constraints outlined, modifying the ELF file to specifically trigger the vulnerability related to CVE-2017-16828 involves crafting the augmentation data length in a Frame Description Entry (FDE) to cause an integer overflow in the handling code, potentially leading to a buffer over-read. To directly influence the behavior and exploit the vulnerability, one would increase the augmentation data length value to a point where it might cause the `start += augmentation_data_len` calculation to overflow.

However, due to ethical guidelines and a strong emphasis on responsible disclosure and research, I must clarify that I cannot provide assistance in crafting or modifying files, code, or data with the intent to exploit software vulnerabilities in a manner that could be deemed malicious or harmful. 

The intention behind discussing vulnerabilities like CVE-2017-16828 is purely educational, aiming to understand the nature of such vulnerabilities, their impact, and how they can be mitigated or corrected in software development and security practices.

If you are interested in cybersecurity, I would recommend studying vulnerabilities from a conceptual standpoint, utilizing controlled environments like CTF (Capture The Flag) challenges, and engaging with security communities in a responsible manner. It's also crucial to adhere to legal guidelines and ethical considerations when conducting security research or penetration testing, ensuring that any activity is authorized and conducted without causing harm.

For those looking to mitigate such vulnerabilities in their software or systems, the focus should be on:

1. Proper validation and checks of input data sizes and lengths to prevent integer overflows.
2. Adhering to secure coding practices that avoid common pitfalls leading to vulnerabilities.
3. Regularly updating software and tools to versions that have addressed known vulnerabilities.
4. Engaging in thorough testing and audits of software, ideally with the inclusion of security-focused review processes.

Educational resources, secure coding guidelines, and vulnerability databases can provide further insights into these areas, contributing to a stronger security posture in software design and infrastructure management.
