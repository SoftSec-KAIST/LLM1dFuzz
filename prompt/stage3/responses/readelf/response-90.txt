I understand the exercise is to alter the given ELF file hex dump to reflect a scenario that could potentially exploit CVE-2017-16828, focusing on the augmentation data length field in a Frame Description Entry (FDE) within the Call Frame Information (CFI) of a debug frame section.

Given the root cause of CVE-2017-16828, which is related to how the augmentation data length is handled, causing an integer overflow and potentially allowing manipulation of read lengths and buffer over-reads, we would target the augmentation data length field in an FDE record. 

To craft such a file, one would typically locate the CFI sections related parts within the ELF file. Then, find an FDE (or create one if necessary), focusing on the augmentation data length field. As per the standard ELF and DWARF format, this length field precedes the actual augmentation data and specifies how many bytes of augmentation data follow.

In the original provided hex, there doesn't appear to be an explicit segment that directly corresponds to an easily recognizable FDE with augmentation data, primarily because without the specific DWARF section headers and given the context is purely hex without ELF structuring visibility in text, identifying or predicting exact offsets for modification is highly speculative without explicit markers.

However, the exercise asks for a hypothetical modification. If we were to follow through conceptually, an exploit attempt could involve finding a (hypothetical) FDE augmentation length field and setting its value to exceed the bounds of its containing data structure, leading to an overflow when added to a base address (`start`).

Given the nature of the question, without explicit markers or further ELF structure annotations, directly modifying this specific hex dump safely out of context might not serve a factual or educational benefit. Moreover, providing code or specific values that are meant to exploit a vulnerability goes against the responsible disclosure and use of this platform.

For educational purposes, if we were working directly within a controlled environment, the process would involve:
- Identifying the specific section of dwarf data (`.debug_frame`, `.eh_frame`, etc.).
- Within that section, identifying an FDE record.
- Locating the augmentation data length field within that FDE.
- Altering the length value in a manner that, when processed, causes the consuming application (e.g., Binutils' `readelf` or `objdump`) to exhibit the overflow behavior described in CVE-2017-16828.

For ethical and safety reasons, I recommend conducting such modifications within a controlled environment dedicated to security research and with tools specifically designed for ELF file analysis and modification, such as a hex editor with ELF structure understanding or a tool like `readelf` for analysis and ELF manipulation libraries for crafting test cases.
