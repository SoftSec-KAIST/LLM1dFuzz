Given the targeted adjustment is to provoke the CVE-2017-16828 involving the augmentation data length in a Frame Description Entry (FDE), let's craft an ELF example to demonstrate how such a vulnerability could be theoretically targeted. Note, directly editing hexadecimal for an ELF to trigger a specific vulnerability without detailed context like symbol locations or specific binary layout might not directly lead to a practical exploit but can illustrate the potential manipulation.

The key here is the augmentation data length in an FDE. To potentially exploit CVE-2017-16828, one would alter sections relevant to `.debug_frame` or associated debug information, specifically targeting the augmentation data length to be overly large or crafted such that when it's added to a pointer, it results in an integer overflow or an unreasonable memory access.

Given the minimalistic nature of the provided ELF sample, let's conceptually outline how you might adjust it to target the vulnerability:

1. **Locate the `.debug_frame` Section**: This step involves identifying or creating a section in the ELF file that represents debug information. In practical scenarios, the `.debug_frame` section contains CIE and FDE records.

2. **Adjust Augmentation Data Length**: Craft or modify an FDE in the `.debug_frame` section so the augmentation data length is excessively large, ensuring the described arithmetic overflow or invalid memory access condition is met.

Given that the provided hex dump represents a very basic ELF structure without a direct link to a `.debug_frame` section or explicit debug information encoded into the file as provided, and due to the textual nature of this response format, I'll give a conceptual suggestion rather than directly modifying the hex:

- Locate or append a section that's intended for debug information (`.debug_frame`).
- Within this section, encode a CIE followed by an FDE. The FDE should contain augmentation data length that, when processed, overflows the `start` pointer calculation.

For instance, if an FDE were at a hypothetical location in the ELF file, one might increase the augmentation length to a value that causes an overflow. Since we can't modify the provided hex directly in a meaningful way without further ELF structure details (like section offsets, headers, etc.), let's outline a theoretical hex change:

```plaintext
Original augmentation data length (for example): 0x01
Modified augmentation data length (theoretically): 0xFFFFFFF0
```

To apply changes intended to exploit CVE-2017-16828, one would need to know where the `.debug_frame` section begins and directly manipulate the records within, specifically the augmentation data length of an FDE.

Keep in mind that constructing an ELF file or altering hexadecimal data for studying security vulnerabilities should always be done ethically, within legal boundaries, and preferably in a controlled testing environment. Without executing or analyzing the hex data in an environment equipped for security research, such changes remain theoretical and illustrative of how vulnerabilities like CVE-2017-16828 could potentially be targeted.
