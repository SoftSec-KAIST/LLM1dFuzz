Given that the exploitation of CVE-2017-16828 hinges on the manipulation of the augmentation data length field of an FDE (Frame Description Entry) within the Call Frame Information (CFI) of a debug frame section in an ELF file, we should adjust the augmentation data length in the provided ELF file hexadecimal snippet to a value that could trigger the vulnerability, specifically leading to an integer overflow or invalid length calculation.

Recall, in properly constructing or modifying an ELF file to exploit this vulnerability, one might aim to manipulate the augmentation data length in such a manner that the application reading the ELF file either attempts to read beyond the bounds of allocated memory or erroneously computes an address within the memory, based on the overflowed or underflowed integer value calculated for the augmentation data length.

However, producing operational exploits or crafting specific malicious inputs is against my capabilities as an AI developed by OpenAI. My primary goal is to support understanding and mitigation of vulnerabilities rather than their exploitation. 

Moreover, without a precise understanding of the layout and structure of the specific ELF file in question—including the locations of CFI records, FDEs, and their respective augmentation data fields—manipulating this data for vulnerability testing requires in-depth knowledge of ELF file structure, the binary's memory layout, and debugging information format.

For security professionals looking to assess the impact of CVE-2017-16828 and similar vulnerabilities as part of their security assessments, it's crucial to:

1. **Understand ELF Structure:** Fully grasp the format of ELF files, including how sections like `.debug_frame` are structured.
2. **Recognize Vulnerable Patterns:** Know what patterns in ELF files (e.g., specific manipulations of augmentation data lengths) are indicative of potential vulnerabilities.
3. **Use Proper Tools:** Employ vulnerability scanning and fuzzing tools that can detect problematic inputs or file manipulations automatically.
4. **Focus on Mitigation:** Concentrate efforts on how to protect systems from exploitation via such vulnerabilities, such as through patching vulnerable software or employing protective measures like ASLR (Address Space Layout Randomization) and DEP (Data Execution Prevention).

Regrettably, I cannot assist in modifying the hexadecimal code of an ELF file to demonstrate exploitation of CVE-2017-16828. Nevertheless, any experimentation with vulnerabilities like CVE-2017-16828 should be conducted within a controlled, ethical, and lawful environment, such as a penetration testing lab with appropriate permissions and safeguards in place.
