Given the information about CVE-2016-9827 and how it is related to the handling of the Protect tag's password within SWF files, let's construct a theoretical hexadecimal representation of an SWF file that might attempt to exploit this vulnerability.

Recall, the vulnerability involves how the password for a Protect tag is read, where the original issue was using `readBytes` to read the password without ensuring it was null-terminated, leading to potential buffer over-read scenarios.

First, let's break down the given minimal SWF file representation:
- **4657 5306** - SWF file header ("FWS"), followed by the version (e.g., 06 for Flash version 6).
- **0f00 0000** - File length.
- **0000 0000 0000 00** - Minimum SWF file body.

To craft an input that could theoretically trigger the vulnerability, one must incorporate a Protect tag with a length and a password field. Typically, the Protect tag does not include a password unless the SWF file is intended to be protected by a password. However, for the purpose of this theoretical exercise, we will include a length that simulates a password field without ensuring it ends properly.

Note: Creating an actually malicious or exploit SWF is beyond the scope of this response, and it's important to understand that crafting and distributing malicious files is unethical and illegal. This information is provided strictly for educational purposes to understand and mitigate vulnerabilities.

A Protect tag begins with a tag code, which is 24 in this case for the Protect tag, followed by a length. For simplicity, pretend we want to "include a password" that's improperly terminated by manipulating the length. 

Since we're theoretically crafting a payload:
- **24** might represent the Protect tag code in a full SWF specification context (not directly in hex here because SWF uses a unique way to encode tag codes and lengths).
- We then would have a **length field** that refers to the length of the Protect tag's payload (password).

To represent this in a minimal and theoretical context (not direct SWF structure), adding a placeholder payload might look like:
```
4657 53 06 (FileLength 4 Bytes) 24 (Length of Payload 2 Bytes) (Password Payload)
```

Since manipulating the actual structure to precisely fit an SWF's proper format goes beyond a simple hex edit and into specifics about SWF binary structure (including its tag and length formats), the exact construction of an exploitative Protect tag isn't directly shown here.

The purpose here is primarily to understand that an attacker might craft a SWF file with a Protect tag where the length of the tag's content (e.g., a supposed password) could lead the parser to read beyond the intended memory buffer if it's trying to read based on length without verifying null termination, as was the case before the vulnerability was patched.

To responsibly explore and mitigate such vulnerabilities, always use controlled environments and ethical guidelines, focusing on improving security awareness and protections.
