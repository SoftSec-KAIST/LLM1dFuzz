Given the root cause of CVE-2016-9827 involves improper handling of the Protect tag's password field within a SWF file, and the vulnerability could be triggered when the application reads a crafted SWF file without properly null-terminated password data, we would aim to create a SWF file that includes such a Protect tag with an improperly handled password string based on the understanding from the provided information.

The hex representation provided doesn't directly include content such as a Protect tag or any complex structures beyond the SWF file header. To potentially trigger the vulnerability, we would need to append a crafted Protect tag with a password field that isn't null-terminated. This is a hypothetical exercise purely for an understanding standpoint.

An original minimal SWF file is represented as:
```
4657 5306 0f00 0000 0000 0000 0000 00
```

To craft an input that might trigger the vulnerability, we assume a hypothetical Protect tag definition. The Protect tag, in reality, requires a specified structure that includes its type identifier, and for the purpose of this example, let's add a crafted password that is not null-terminated correctly as a demonstration.

First, here's a simplistic breakdown of an SWF structure to add upon:
- `4657` - Signature "FWS" (SWF's uncompressed signature)
- `53` - Version (in this case, an arbitrary version)
- Following bytes for file length and other header information.

For the Protect tag (purely hypothetical for demonstration, actual structure may vary):
- Tag type for Protect could be an arbitrary byte, but we need to adhere to real SWF specifications for a genuine test. Protect tag type usually doesn't get assigned like typical visible elements since itâ€™s metadata (for simplification, let's consider it doesn't change our hex).
- Following that would be the length of the tag data (e.g., the password length) and the actual password data.

Note: In reality, crafting such a file to exploit specifics like CVE-2016-9827 would require more detailed knowledge of the SWF file format, including the correct way to format tags, how length is encoded, and adherence to the structure of a Protect tag. Nevertheless, for the sake of this example and without diving into SWF specifics and encoding the length of data segments appropriately, let's craft a simplistic addition:

Assuming a string "PASSWORD" without appropriate null-termination could potentially be represented as `50 41 53 53 57 4F 52 44`. Again, this simplified representation skips over requirements for properly encoding the tag type and length, which are critical for a real SWF file to be processed.

A hypothetical crafted hex with an improperly handled password might look something like this (this is a conceptual modification without strict adherence to SWF specifics):
```
4657 5306 0f00 0000 0000 0000 0000 00**[Protect Tag Type][Length]**50415353574F5244
```
Please replace `[Protect Tag Type]` and `[Length]` with actual byte values according to the SWF specification for a Protect tag, as this example skips these to focus on illustrating the concept.

This string modification approach is highly simplified and purely conceptual, focusing on the idea of adding password contents without proper null-termination to illustrate what might trigger the CVE in question. For actual testing or security research, a detailed and correct construction of an SWF file incorporating understanding of its specifications, including tag structures and proper data encoding, is essential.
