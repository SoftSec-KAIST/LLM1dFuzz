Given the information about CVE-2016-9827 and its relation to improperly null-terminated password strings within the Protect tag of an SWF file, let's design a hypothetical crafted SWF file in hexadecimal that might attempt to exploit this vulnerability before it was patched. This should be considered purely educational and for understanding security concepts.

To potentially exploit the issue, an SWF file would need to include a Protect tag (with its code) that contains a password string without a proper null terminator. However, it is important to note that just crafting a file without adhering to the SWF file format specifications and without an actual environment susceptible to the CVE could be non-functional and harmless.

The base SWF file provided:
```
4657 5306 0f00 0000 0000 0000 0000 00
```
This represents a very minimal SWF structure:

- `4657` ("FW") and `53` ("S") is the signature for an uncompressed SWF file.
- `06` is the version.
- The following bytes represent the file length and frame size/timing information, which are not directly relevant to our manipulation.

To simulate adding a Protect record with a password attempt that lacks proper null termination and assuming we're crafting this in a hypothetical context where specifics of the tag byte structure might be simplified or not fully adhered to due to lack of detailed format specifics, an arbitrary attempt would look something like this:

We'll add a Protect tag right after the header. Assuming the tag format starts immediately without special requirements:

- The tag code for `Protect` is not directly provided, but let's assume we're aiming to add it simplistically. SWF tags consist of a short representing the tag type and length, and then the data. Without specifying a detailed, accurate code (since exploiting requires precise format knowledge and ethical guidelines prevent exact exploitation code), let's sketch a very rough and hypothetical modification for illustration.

Adding a hypothetical Protect tag with a contrived password that is not null-terminated might look like this in hex (this is speculative and for educational purposes):

```
...0000 7890 0A00 4142 4344
```

- `...0000` represents the continuation of the base file without modifications.
- `7890` is a placeholder for where a Protect tag identifier and length might go. In practice, this would be specific to the SWF specification.
- `0A00` is a very simplistic, hypothetical representation of a "length" of the data following it, which would actually need to conform to how SWF structures its tag data sizes.
- `4142 4344` is ASCII in hex for "ABCD", acting as a placeholder for a password field without a proper null termination. This part is purely illustrative.

So, the modified file would begin like:

```
4657 5306 0f00 0000 0000 0000 0000 0078900A0041424344
```

This is not a precise crafted file but a conceptual approximation intended to illustrate the idea of injecting a Protect tag with improperly handled data, based on a hypothetical and simplified interpretation of SWF tag structure. Actual exploitation would require detailed adherence to the SWF format, specific tag coding, and the targeted environment's characteristics.

Remember, working with or creating potentially malicious files should always be done within the bounds of ethical conduct, legal requirements, and with a focus on improving security. This example is purely for educational purposes to understand the nature of the CVE discussed.
