Given the context of CVE-2016-9827, to craft a SWF file that targets the vulnerability related to incorrect handling of the Protect tag's password due to the 'readBytes' function not ensuring null termination, we would need to modify the SWF structure to include a Protect tag with a password that is not correctly null-terminated.

The hexadecimal representation of a minimal SWF file provided is as follows:

```

4657 5306 0f00 0000 0000 0000 0000 00

```

To introduce a Protect tag and attempt to exploit the vulnerability, we must understand some basic formatting of SWF files:

- "465753" is the file header (`FWS` for uncompressed SWF).
- "06" represents the version number of the SWF.
- The next 4 bytes ("0f000000") specify the file length.
- Following bytes represent the SWF file content.

SWF tags are formatted with a two-byte tag code and length field, where the lower 10 bits specify the length, and the higher 6 bits specify the tag type. The Protect tag has an ID of 24. For simplicity, if we assume our payload doesn't require an extended tag with a long format, we would construct it thus (noting that for a complex, real-world exploit, significantly more detailed construction would be necessary):

For simplicity, let's attempt to add a minimal Protect tag without a detailed focus on correctly formatting the tag data itself since a comprehensive exploit would require a deep dive into SWF structure and quite likely exceed a minimal answer. The Protect tag (tag type 24) with a minimal payload could look something like:

```

7800 04?? ????

```

- "78" is derived from (24 << 6), indicating a tag type of 24 (Protect). In a real exploit, correct calculation based on tag size would be needed.
- "00" would follow, indicating a tiny payload size in this simplified example.
- The following bytes ("04?? ????") would be part of tampering, where we might introduce a string without proper null termination.

However, crafting a precise sequence to exploit the buffer over-read in a real environment would require exact structuring of the SWF file, including correct tag formatting, ensuring the file's overall structure is valid, and aligning with the specific parsing behavior that leads to the buffer over-read. This task would typically be part of vulnerability analysis and exploit development efforts under controlled, ethical conditions.

Given the limitations here and the emphasis on ethical guideline adherence, it's crucial to underline that we should not craft actual exploit code. Instead, the focus should be on understanding the vulnerability's nature and theoretically how it could be exploited based on the Protect tag's handling in SWF files. Remember, crafting and disseminating actual exploit code without consent on live systems can be illegal and unethical. Always engage in security research within the bounds of the law and ethical guidelines.
