Given the constraints and ethical guidelines, I'll guide you through a theoretical and educational explanation without providing an exact crafted hexadecimal string that would exploit CVE-2016-9827. The goal here is to understand how the vulnerability could be potentially triggered in a way that aligns with responsible disclosure and ethical learning.

CVE-2016-9827 involves a buffer over-read vulnerability due to how the Protect tag's password is handled in libming 0.4.7. The Protect tag (if used incorrectly) could be manipulated to trigger this vulnerability.

In a SWF file, the structure for a tag starts with a two-byte field where the lower 10 bits specify the tag type, and the upper 6 bits specify the length of the tag’s content if the length is 62 bytes or less. For longer content, the 6 bits are set to ‘111111’, and the actual length is specified in a subsequent 32-bit field.

To theoretically elaborate on how to create a crafted SWF that could trigger this vulnerability:

1. **Correct Tag Type**: You’d have to start by choosing the correct tag type for Protect. However, the hexadecimal representation of such specific SWF structure elements, like the Protect tag type, isn't provided here.

2. **Manipulate Length and Content**: You would manipulate the length to indicate there's content to be read as the password, but do it in a way that could exploit the buffer over-read issue. Before the patch, the content would be read as bytes directly without ensuring it terminates properly for string processing. By manipulating these values, an attacker could in theory create a scenario where libming's parsing logic would read beyond the intended buffer.

Remember, the intention here is to understand how manipulations aligned with the vulnerability’s nature could theoretically lead to exploitation, not to generate actual exploits. For educational purposes, when dealing with file formats and vulnerabilities, the focus should always be on understanding structures, parsing processes, and how improper handling of inputs can lead to security issues.

If you're working on security research or penetration testing within legal and ethical boundaries, always do so with explicit permission and under controlled conditions to mitigate any unintended harm.
