Given the nature of the vulnerability (CVE-2016-9827) concerning libming's handling of the Protect tag's Password field and the requirement for the crafted SWF file to potentially exploit the buffer over-read issue by not ensuring the Password is null-terminated, let's attempt to construct a hypothetical example. The focus here is academic, understanding how such vulnerabilities could be triggered, which is essential for developing more secure software.

The minimal SWF file provided previously doesn't contain a Protect tag (or any tag that could hold a Password field). To potentially exploit the vulnerability, we should insert a Protect tag (`0x24`) followed by a length indicator showing the size of the Password field, and then the Password data itself. 

For this exercise, given the original hexadecimal representation of the minimal SWF file:
```
4657 5306 0f00 0000 0000 0000 0000 00
```
we need to extend this SWF file to include a Protect tag, a length field, and then some Password data without a null terminator. The Protect tag format in an SWF file can be simplified as follows (not precisely aligned to any specification, just for illustrative purposes in the context of this example):
- Tag type and length (if the Password is included, which is not always the case)
- Password data (optional)

In our crafted case:
- We'll add a hypothetical Protect tag (`0x24` for the tag, though in reality, the format includes both the tag and length in a single field).
- Indicate a length (let's say 4 bytes for the length, not following the exact SWF specification but to illustrate the point).
- Add a "Password" of arbitrary data without a null terminator.

However, it's crucial to understand real SWF tag structure complexities and length encoding mechanisms. SWF uses a specific format for tag and length indicating (using a combination of bits to represent both). For simplicity in this exercise, we'll not fully align with those details, as the primary goal is to conceptualize how such data might trigger the vulnerability without aiming for a directly executable SWF file.

Given the limitations above, a "crafted" hexadecimal sequence (purely hypothetical and not executable) might look like this:
```
4657 5306 2A00 0000 0000 2400 0400 41414141
```

In this sequence:
- `4657 5306` is the SWF header for a version 6 file.
- `2A00 0000` might be a placeholder for the overall file length and frame data (oversimplified).
- `0000 2400` introduces our hypothetical Protect tag (`24`) with a length (`0004` for 4 bytes, highly simplified and not accurately reflecting SWF encoding).
- `0400 41414141` indicates a length followed by "AAAA" as the Password data without a null terminator. 

This example is not technically accurate for constructing an actual SWF file but is aimed to conceptualize how data might be structured to exploit the described vulnerability based on misunderstanding or mishandling the end of the Password string. Creating a real exploit would require a precise understanding of the SWF format, correctly encoding tag types and lengths, and ensuring the crafted file could be parsed by the target application up to the point of exploiting the vulnerability. This exercise underscores the importance of handling external input data correctly, especially when security mechanisms like password protection are involved.
