The root cause of CVE-2019-11041 can be inferred from the patch and description provided. This vulnerability is due to a heap buffer overflow in the PHP EXIF extension when it is parsing EXIF information from an image using the `exif_read_data()` function. Specifically, the vulnerability arises because the PHP EXIF extension does not adequately check the size of the buffer that will hold the EXIF data before attempting to read EXIF information. This oversight allows for situations where the extension can be supplied with data that will cause it to read past the end of the allocated buffer.

From the patch provided, we can see the specific fix introduces a condition to check that the `ImageInfo->Thumbnail.size` is at least 4 bytes before proceeding with the data parsing. By ensuring this condition, the patch effectively prevents the extension from attempting to read EXIF information when the data size is too small, which in turn prevents the out-of-bounds read that leads to heap buffer overflow vulnerabilities.

Heap buffer overflows can lead to a variety of adverse outcomes ranging from information disclosure (where unauthorized access to memory can leak sensitive information) to crashes (due to the program attempting to access memory outside of its allocated space), and potentially even arbitrary code execution, depending on the context and specifics of the overflow.

Therefore, the root cause of CVE-2019-11041 is a missing size check before reading EXIF data, which would allow an attacker to craft an image in such a way that, when processed, it could lead to an out-of-bounds memory read, potentially leading to information disclosure, denial of service, or more severe impacts depending on the exploitation.
