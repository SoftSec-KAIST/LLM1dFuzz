The root cause of CVE-2019-11041 appears to be a heap-buffer-overflow vulnerability within the PHP EXIF extension, specifically when parsing EXIF information from an image. This issue arises from the function `exif_read_data()` not properly validating or ensuring that it reads within the bounds of allocated memory when processing an image's EXIF data.

From the provided patch, the underlying problem seems to stem from a lack of adequate checks before processing the thumbnail data embedded within the EXIF information. Before the fix, there wasn't a check to ensure that the size of the provided thumbnail data (`ImageInfo->Thumbnail.size`) was large enough for the operations carried out on it (`< 4`), leading to a scenario where the application could attempt to read or write beyond the buffer allocated for the thumbnail image data. This could potentially allow an attacker to exploit this out-of-bounds read to cause a crash (denial-of-service) or leak sensitive information from memory.

The patch addresses this vulnerability by adding an additional condition in the `exif_scan_thumbnail` function that checks if the `ImageInfo->Thumbnail.size` is less than 4 bytes, in which case the function returns FALSE, indicating there's "nothing to do here" and effectively preventing the out-of-bounds read from occurring. This is a classic example of a boundary check that prevents buffer overflow by ensuring the operations do not exceed the allocated memory limits.
