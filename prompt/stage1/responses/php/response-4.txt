Based on the information provided about CVE-2019-11041 and a glance at the patch, the root cause of the vulnerability seems to be a heap buffer overflow issue in the way PHP's EXIF extension parses EXIF data from images. Specifically, the vulnerability arises from not adequately checking the size of the input data before processing it, which could allow an attacker to supply specially crafted data that causes the program to read beyond the allocated buffer. This could lead to potentially serious consequences such as information disclosure or causing a crash.

The patch addresses the issue by adding a check to ensure that `ImageInfo->Thumbnail.size` is at least 4 bytes before continuing with the processing. This change prevents the function from proceeding when the data provided is too small, which would likely lead to an attempt to read beyond the allocated buffer.

By examining the patch:

```diff

-       if (!data) {
+       if (!data || ImageInfo->Thumbnail.size < 4) {
                return FALSE; /* nothing to do here */
        }
        if (memcmp(data, "\xFF\xD8\xFF", 3)) {
```

It's clear that the vulnerability was due to insufficient validation of input data size before attempting to process it. By ensuring that the data has a minimum size, the updated code helps prevent the condition that led to the buffer overflow vulnerability. This fix is a common approach to mitigating buffer overflows, which involve ensuring that any buffer reads or writes are done only after validating the sizes of inputs and ensuring they do not exceed the allocated memory bounds.
