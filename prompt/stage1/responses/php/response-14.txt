Based on the CVE-2019-11041 description and the provided patch, the root cause of the vulnerability seems to be improper handling of EXIF data, specifically when parsing the EXIF information from an image using the PHP EXIF extension. The issue arises when the `exif_read_data()` function is used to process specially crafted data that causes the function to read past the allocated buffer. This is a typical example of a buffer overflow vulnerability, which in this context could lead to information disclosure or a crash.

The root cause lies in the lack of sufficient validation checks to ensure that the buffer, which is to be read, contains enough data for the operation. When the EXIF extension attempts to parse the thumbnail data from the EXIF information, it does not adequately check that the size of the thumbnail data (as reported within the EXIF data itself) is large enough for the read operations that it intends to perform. This lack of validation could allow an attacker to supply specially crafted image files designed to exploit this oversight, potentially causing the software to access memory beyond the bounds of the allocated buffer.

The specific patch addresses this vulnerability by adding a condition to check whether `ImageInfo->Thumbnail.size` is less than 4 before proceeding with further processing. By ensuring that there's a minimum size for the thumbnail data, the patch effectively mitigates the risk of reading beyond the allocated memory. This change prevents the exploit by aborting the processing of the thumbnail data if the size criteria are not met, thus safeguarding against the buffer overflow and its associated risks.

In summary, the root cause of CVE-2019-11041 is a buffer overflow vulnerability due to insufficient validation of the size of the thumbnail data within an image's EXIF information when processed by the PHP EXIF extension. The patch fixes this issue by introducing a mandatory size check to ensure that there's enough data before attempting to read the thumbnail, thereby preventing the overflow.
