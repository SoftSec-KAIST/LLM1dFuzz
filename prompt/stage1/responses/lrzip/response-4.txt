The root cause of CVE-2018-11496 in Long Range Zip (lrzip) 0.631 appears to be a use-after-free vulnerability that stems from insufficient size validation during the file decompression process. Specifically, the issue occurs in the `read_stream` function in `stream.c`. This function, which is part of the process for reading data from a stream during decompression, does not properly handle cases where the size of the decompressed file does not match expected parameters. 

The use-after-free situation arises because the code does not correctly manage memory when handling the stream buffer (`s->buf`). Initially, the buffer is used without checking if it is still valid or has been freed elsewhere in the program, which could lead to attempts to access or manipulate freed memory -- a common type of security vulnerability.

The patch provided addresses this issue in two significant ways:

1. It sets the buffer pointer to `NULL` after its associated memory has been freed: `ucthread[s->unext_thread].s_buf = NULL;`. This change ensures that any subsequent access attempts will not try to use memory that has already been freed, thus preventing the use-after-free bug.

2. It introduces a check to ensure that the stream buffer (`s->buf`) is not `NULL` before proceeding with memory copy operations: `if (unlikely(!s->buf)) failure_return(("Stream ran out prematurely, likely corrupt archive\n"), -1);`. This additional validation step is designed to catch scenarios where the decompression process encounters irregular or unexpected conditions (e.g., corrupt archive data), potentially mitigating the risk of accessing invalid memory.

By addressing the improper memory management and adding more rigorous size validation checks, the patch aims to eliminate the use-after-free condition and reduce the risk of exploitable vulnerabilities during the decompression process in lrzip.
