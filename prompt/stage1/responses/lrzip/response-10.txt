The root cause of CVE-2018-11496 in Long Range Zip (lrzip) 0.631 involves a use-after-free vulnerability in the `read_stream` function within `stream.c`. This vulnerability is triggered because `decompress_file` in `lrzip.c` does not perform adequate size validation.

A use-after-free vulnerability occurs when the program continues using a pointer after it has freed the memory it points to. This can lead to unpredictable behavior, including crashing the program or, more importantly, enabling an attacker to execute arbitrary code.

Looking at the patch, we see measures introduced to address the use of a dangling pointer (pointing to already freed memory). The assignment `ucthread[s->unext_thread].s_buf = NULL;` is critical in preventing the use-after-free occurrence by ensuring that the pointer is set to NULL after its associated memory has been used and is no longer valid for access. This effectively prevents the program from using this pointer unintentionally in a harmful way after the memory has been freed, as attempting to access a NULL pointer will be much more predictable and safer (typically resulting in a crash rather than arbitrary code execution or other undefined behavior).

Additionally, within the `read_stream` function, a check is introduced to ensure that `s->buf` is not NULL before proceeding with operations involving this pointer. This check acts as a safety measure to prevent the program from attempting to read from or write to a NULL pointer, which would result in a crash. By adding `if (unlikely(!s->buf)) failure_return(("Stream ran out prematurely, likely corrupt archive\n"), -1);`, it preemptively catches cases where the pointer would be invalid due to issues like stream corruption, contributing to the overall robustness of error handling in the context of stream processing.

In summary, the root cause relates to insufficient validation and handling of conditions that could lead to the use of a freed memory. The patch addresses this by ensuring that once a memory area associated with a buffer is done being used, its pointer is nullified to prevent its reuse, and by adding checks to gracefully handle potential error states.
