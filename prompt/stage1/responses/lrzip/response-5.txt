Based on the provided information and patch for CVE-2018-11496, the root cause appears to be a use-after-free vulnerability in the Long Range Zip (lrzip) software version 0.631. This vulnerability specifically occurs in the `read_stream` function in `stream.c` due to the lack of proper size validation in `decompress_file` function within `lrzip.c`.

A use-after-free issue happens when a program continues to use a pointer after it has freed the memory it points to. This can lead to unpredictable behavior, including access violations, data corruption, or arbitrary code execution, depending on how the freed memory gets reallocated and used subsequently.

In this particular case, the program does not adequately validate the size of the data it attempts to decompress. This lack of validation can result in situations where lrzip tries to use memory that has already been freed, leading to the use-after-free condition that constitutes the vulnerability.

The provided patch addresses this issue with two primary changes:

1. It ensures that once a thread is finished with its decompression buffer (`s_buf`), the buffer is explicitly set to NULL: `ucthread[s->unext_thread].s_buf = NULL;`. This change helps to prevent the use-after-free by ensuring that any subsequent accidental attempt to use this buffer will encounter a NULL pointer rather than potentially using freed memory.

2. It introduces a safety check before accessing the buffer: `if (unlikely(!s->buf)) failure_return(("Stream ran out prematurely, likely corrupt archive\n"), -1);`. This check ensures that if, for some reason, the buffer is NULL (either because it was never allocated or because it was explicitly set to NULL as per the previous change), the function will cleanly return with an error message indicating a likely corrupt archive instead of proceeding and potentially triggering a use-after-free condition.

Thus, the root cause of CVE-2018-11496 is inadequate validation and handling of decompressed data sizes, which leads to a situation where the software might use memory that has already been freed, posing a security risk. The patch mitigates this risk by ensuring proper nullification of pointers after use and adding checks to handle cases where the expected data buffer is not available.
