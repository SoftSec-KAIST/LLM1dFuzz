The root cause of CVE-2018-11496 stems from a lack of adequate size validation when handling compressed data within the Long Range Zip (lrzip) software. Specifically, the vulnerability is a use-after-free issue in the `read_stream` function within `stream.c`. The problem arises because the `decompress_file` function in `lrzip.c` does not perform sufficient validation of the sizes of compressed data streams.

When lrzip attempts to decompress a file, it reads the compressed data into memory. Due to the lack of size validation, it is possible for lrzip to deallocate a data buffer (`s_buf`) while still retaining references to this buffer elsewhere in the program. Subsequent usage of these dangling references to the deallocated buffer can lead to use-after-free conditions. This kind of memory corruption vulnerability can potentially be exploited to execute arbitrary code.

The patch fixes the vulnerability by addressing the root cause in two ways:

1. **Preventing a dangling pointer:** The line `ucthread[s->unext_thread].s_buf = NULL;` ensures that after a thread's data buffer (`s_buf`) is used, the pointer to it is set to `NULL`. This change prevents the program from holding onto a pointer to a buffer that has already been consumed and potentially freed. By nullifying the pointer after use, the patch mitigates the risk of use-after-free errors because subsequent attempts to access the buffer will now clearly indicate that the buffer is no longer available.

2. **Adding a validation check:** The lines
   ```
   if (unlikely(!s->buf))
       failure_return(("Stream ran out prematurely, likely corrupt archive\n"), -1);
   ```
   introduce a check prior to copying data from the buffer into the destination. This check ensures that the source buffer (`s->buf`) is not NULL before proceeding. This is a direct mitigation against the use-after-free scenario by adding a validation step that was previously missing. If the buffer has prematurely run out (for instance, due to corruption or a crafted archive designed to exploit this vulnerability), the function now returns an error instead of proceeding to use a freed buffer.

In summary, the root cause of CVE-2018-11496 is insufficient validation of compressed data stream sizes, leading to use-after-free vulnerabilities. The provided patch addresses this by ensuring pointers to used buffers are nullified and by adding checks to ensure that data is only copied from valid, non-NULL buffers, thereby preventing misuse of freed memory.
