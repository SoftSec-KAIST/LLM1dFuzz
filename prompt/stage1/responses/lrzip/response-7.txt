Given the information about CVE-2018-11496 and the patch provided, it seems that the root cause of the vulnerability was a use-after-free error in the `read_stream` function in `stream.c`. The `decompress_file` function in `lrzip.c` did not properly validate the size of a decompressed data stream, potentially allowing a specially crafted or corrupt archive to cause the program to attempt to use memory that had already been freed. This could lead to a variety of undesirable behaviors including program crashes or, potentially, arbitrary code execution depending on how the memory might be manipulated after being freed.

The patch addresses this issue by:

1. **Nullifying the pointer after use**: By setting `ucthread[s->unext_thread].s_buf` to `NULL` after its associated data has been moved to `s->buf`, the patch prevents the freed memory from being used again. This adjustment eradicates the use-after-free condition since the pointer is no longer pointing to freed memory â€“ it's nullified, signaling that the memory area it previously pointed to is no longer valid or accessible.

2. **Adding a validation check**: The patch introduces a safety check (`if (unlikely(!s->buf))`) to verify that `s->buf` is not `NULL` before proceeding with memory operations like `memcpy`. If `s->buf` is `NULL`, indicating that there's no valid data to read (possibly due to corruption or an attack attempt), the function returns an error. This additional validation acts as a defense mechanism to prevent the program from operating on invalid or unexpected data states, which could lead to crashes or exploitation.

In summary, the root cause of CVE-2018-11496 was a use-after-free error resulting from inadequate validation of decompressed data sizes and insufficient handling of pointer lifecycles. The provided patch mitigates this vulnerability by ensuring that once data has been used and the memory is no longer needed, the pointer to that memory is nullified to prevent reuse, and by adding an explicit check for an invalid (`NULL`) pointer before attempting to read from it.
