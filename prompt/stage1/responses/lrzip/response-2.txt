The root cause of CVE-2018-11496 in Long Range Zip (lrzip) version 0.631 appears to be a use-after-free vulnerability in the handling of decompression streams. Specifically, the issue occurs in the `read_stream` function within `stream.c`, which interacts with the decompression process managed by `decompress_file` in `lrzip.c`. The vulnerability is triggered because `decompress_file` does not perform adequate size validation when processing decompressed data streams. This oversight means that lrzip can attempt to use memory (referenced by `s->buf`) after it has been freed, leading to potential memory corruption, crashes, or other unintended behavior.

The patch addresses this vulnerability by ensuring that `ucthread[s->unext_thread].s_buf` is set to NULL after its data has been transferred to `s->buf`, preventing subsequent use of the already freed memory buffer. Additionally, it adds a validation check before accessing the buffer (`s->buf`) to handle cases where the decompression stream might prematurely run out, likely due to a corrupt or crafted archive. If `s->buf` is unexpectedly NULL, the program now fails gracefully, reporting a potential corruption issue rather than proceeding and risking a use-after-free scenario.

In essence, the lack of sufficient validation of decompression stream sizes and improper handling of dynamically allocated memory were the fundamental causes leading to this vulnerability. The patch corrects these flaws by improving memory management and error checking logic to cope with corrupted or specially crafted archive stream overruns.
