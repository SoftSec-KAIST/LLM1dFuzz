The root cause of CVE-2018-11496 in Long Range Zip (lrzip) version 0.631 is a use-after-free vulnerability occurring in `read_stream` in `stream.c`. This vulnerability is triggered due to a lack of adequate size validation in `decompress_file` in `lrzip.c`. Essentially, the program fails to properly validate the size of the decompressed data which it processes, leading to scenarios where it might attempt to use memory that has already been freed. This can happen when managing the decompression of files, particularly when handling corrupted or specially crafted archive streams.

In the context of memory management and security, a use-after-free error occurs when a program continues to use a pointer after the memory it points to has been freed. This can lead to unpredictable behavior, including program crashes, data corruption, or even the execution of arbitrary code, depending on how the memory is subsequently used or manipulated.

The patch provided addresses this vulnerability by adding critical checks and modifications to the memory handling mechanism:

1. It sets the `ucthread[s->unext_thread].s_buf` to `NULL` after the buffer is assigned to `s->buf`. This change ensures that once a thread's buffer is used, it's marked as unavailable by setting its reference to `NULL`, preventing subsequent use-after-free attempts because the buffer is no longer considered valid.
   
2. It introduces a verification step with an `if (unlikely(!s->buf))` check before performing operations with `s->buf`. This additional if-condition checks if `s->buf` is `NULL`, which would indicate that the stream has run out or that the archive being decompressed is likely corrupt, and if so, it fails gracefully. This prevents the program from attempting to read from or write to freed memory.

These changes cope with corrupt or crafted archive stream overruns by ensuring that the program does not use memory after it has been freed, thereby preventing the use-after-free scenario from occurring. The requirement for size validation as mentioned in the CVE description aims to avoid processing invalid data sizes that could lead to memory management issues, ensuring that the decompression process is conducted securely and reliably.
