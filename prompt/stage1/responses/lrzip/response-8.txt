The root cause of CVE-2018-11496 in Long Range Zip (lrzip) 0.631 as described lies in a use-after-free vulnerability within the `read_stream` function in `stream.c`. The issue occurs because `decompress_file` in `lrzip.c` does not perform sufficient size validation before operating on the data. This inadequacy can lead to a scenario where an uninitialized or already freed memory location is accessed after its initial use, a common critical security problem known as use-after-free. This kind of vulnerability can lead to unpredictable behavior such as crashes, data corruption, or in worse cases, execution of arbitrary code.

The provided patch addresses this issue by ensuring that once a stream buffer (`s_buf`) is used, it is immediately set to NULL. This prevents the buffer from being accessed after it has been freed or reallocated, effectively mitigating the use-after-free vulnerability. Moreover, the patch includes a condition to check if the buffer pointer (`s->buf`) is NULL before proceeding with memory operations, adding an additional layer of validation to prevent corruption or crashes due to premature stream exhaustion, which could be indicative of a corrupt archive.

Simply put, the root cause is the lack of proper validation and safeguarding against the use of memory locations that have been freed or are no longer valid for use, which the patch aims to fix by nullifying pointers immediately after their use and introducing checks for invalid pointer use scenarios.
