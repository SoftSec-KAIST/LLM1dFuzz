The root cause of CVE-2018-11496 in Long Range Zip (lrzip) 0.631 appears to stem from an issue of not properly validating the size of a decompressed file stream before using it, which can lead to a use-after-free vulnerability. This kind of vulnerability occurs when a program continues to use a memory reference (a pointer) after it has been freed or released back to the system's memory allocator. Continuing to use a freed memory reference can lead to unpredictable behavior, including crashing the program or, in worse cases, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code.

The patch provided in the commit addresses this issue by introducing a couple of key fixes:

1. **Null Assignment Post-Use**: After using a buffer (`s->buf`), it sets its reference to `NULL`. This nullification acts as a safeguard, preventing the buffer from being used after its intended lifecycle. By doing this, even if another part of the program attempts to use this pointer again, it would be pointing to `NULL`, significantly reducing the risk of a use-after-free vulnerability because accessing a `NULL` pointer is more likely to result in an immediate and detectable error.

2. **Validation Check Added**: Before using the buffer data (`s->buf`), the code now includes a validation check (`if (unlikely(!s->buf))`) to ensure that the buffer is not `NULL`. This check directly tackles the described problem by ensuring that the buffer is valid before use. If the buffer has been prematurely emptied or invalidated (indicating potential corruption or a crafted, malicious archive), the operation is aborted, and an error message is generated.

These fixes address the root cause by incorporating defensive programming practices: specifically, ensuring that variables are validated before use and properly managed (i.e., setting to `NULL` after use) to mitigate the risks associated with memory management errors such as use-after-free vulnerabilities. This patch effectively prevents the misuse of freed memory by adding an explicit check for buffer validity and preventing its unintended reuse, thereby countering the issue where `decompress_file` in `lrzip.c` lacked sufficient size validation for the decompressed file stream.
