The root cause of CVE-2018-13785 in libpng 1.6.34 appears to be related to an integer overflow and resultant divide-by-zero vulnerability within the `png_check_chunk_length` function in `pngrutil.c`. When processing a crafted PNG file, the application calculates the `row_factor` without sufficiently ensuring that the multiplication does not result in an integer overflow. The calculation involves the image width (`png_ptr->width`), the number of color channels (`png_ptr->channels`), and the bit depth (`png_ptr->bit_depth`), among other factors.

Here's a breakdown of the issue:

- **Inadequate Type Handling**: Initially, the calculation of `row_factor` does not explicitly cast the operands to a size capable of holding the result of the multiplication, thereby risking an integer overflow. This is particularly risky given that the multiplication involves several parameters of the image, which could be manipulated in a crafted PNG file.

- **Integer Overflow**: The calculated `row_factor` could overflow if a crafted image specifies very large width, channels, or bit depth values. This overflow can lead to a situation where the resultant `row_factor` is inaccurately small.

- **Resultant Divide-by-Zero**: If an integer overflow occurs, subsequent calculations that depend on `row_factor` could inadvertently lead to a divide-by-zero condition, especially if the overflowed `row_factor` value is used in a context where it is assumed to be meaningfully large. The divide-by-zero condition can lead to a denial of service (DoS) as the application could crash or become unresponsive.

The patch addresses this vulnerability by ensuring the operands in the `row_factor` calculation are cast to `size_t`, a type that is appropriately sized for holding the result of the multiplication, thus reducing the risk of overflow. This is evident from the addition of explicit casts to `size_t` for `png_ptr->width`, `png_ptr->channels`, and the other operands involved in the multiplication.

Furthermore, the patch refines checks against `idat_limit` and adjusts the assignment logic to ensure that the application gracefully handles large values without leading to overflow or divide-by-zero errors. By doing so, it mitigates the risk of processing specially crafted PNG files that could trigger these vulnerabilities, thereby enhancing the robustness of the library against potential denial of service attacks.
