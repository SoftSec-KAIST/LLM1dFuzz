The root cause of CVE-2018-13785 in libpng 1.6.34 is an incorrect calculation for `row_factor` in the `png_check_chunk_length` function, as seen in the file `pngrutil.c`. This incorrect calculation could lead to an integer overflow. When handling specially crafted PNG files, this overflow could then cause a divide-by-zero situation. The consequences of this vulnerability include a potential denial of service (DoS) if malicious actors exploit the divide-by-zero error by triggering a crash in applications or systems using the vulnerable libpng version to process PNG images.

Looking closely at the patch provided to fix this vulnerability:
- The calculation of `row_factor` was altered to ensure safe multiplication and addition, guarding against integer overflow. By casting `png_ptr->width` and `png_ptr->channels` to `size_t` before performing the operations, the code adjusts how these values are handled, specifically considering their potential sizes.
- Incorporating explicit casts to `size_t` helps ensure that the intermediate results of the multiplication can accommodate larger values without overflowing, which was the main issue leading to the vulnerability.
- The patch doesn’t directly address a "divide-by-zero" fix. Instead, it prevents the situation from occurring by ensuring `row_factor` is calculated correctly and cannot overflow, indirectly addressing the divide-by-zero potential by fixing its root cause—an incorrect `row_factor` calculation that could lead to an invalid state.

The fundamental issue was the potential for the original `row_factor` calculation to exceed the bounds of acceptable values for later operations, primarily due to not safely accommodating the sizes of input values (like width, channels, and bit depth of a PNG image). By correcting this calculation, the patch mitigates the risk of an integer overflow and the subsequent risk of a divide-by-zero error during PNG file processing. This patch addresses the vulnerability by fixing the root cause and ensuring the stability and security of the libpng library when handling PNG files, thereby preventing a possible DoS attack.
