The root cause of CVE-2018-19758 based on the provided description and patch seems to be a programming mistake that leads to a heap-based buffer over-read vulnerability in the libsndfile library, specifically within the function responsible for writing WAV file headers (`wav_write_header` in `wav.c`). This vulnerability could allow an attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) attack via specially crafted input, likely due to an incorrect calculation or unchecked boundary that leads to reading beyond the allocated memory bounds.

The patch provided addresses this vulnerability by adding a safeguard to ensure that the value of `loop_count` (which appears to be the culprit leading to the heap over-read) is limited to a sensible range. The following line was added to the code:

```c
/* Loop count is signed 16 bit number so we limit its range to something sensible. */
psf->instrument->loop_count &= 0x7fff ;
```

This effectively ensures that the `loop_count` variable does not exceed the maximum positive value for a signed 16-bit integer (32767 or 0x7FFF), preventing the possibility of causing an overflow or over-read when the library processes loop count information. 

In addition, examining the comments and changes, we can infer that incorrect or unchecked handling of the loop count value when processing WAV files could lead to scenarios where the application attempts to read beyond the allocated memory for the WAV file's metadata, leading to a denial of service.

Thus, the root cause can be summarized as an incorrect handling or unchecked bounds for the `loop_count` variable used in processing WAV file headers, which was fixed by ensuring the variable is restricted to a valid range, preventing an out-of-bounds read.
