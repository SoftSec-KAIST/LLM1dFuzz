The root cause of CVE-2018-19758 stems from a heap-based buffer over-read in the wav.c file, specifically within the `wav_write_header` function of libsndfile version 1.0.28. This vulnerability can lead to a denial of service (DoS) as a result of the software reading beyond the buffer limit.

From the provided patch, it appears that the issue was addressed by correcting how the loop count variable is handled. Before the patch, there wasn't a safeguard to ensure that the loop count remains within a valid range, which could allow for the read operation to exceed the allocated buffer size.

The patch introduces a change that ensures the `loop_count` value is masked with `0x7fff`, effectively ensuring that it cannot exceed the maximum value for a signed 16-bit number (32767). This is a critical fix because it prevents the function from attempting to read or write beyond the allocated memory space for an instrument loop count, which could otherwise lead to out-of-bounds memory access, causing a crash and resulting in a denial of service.

Additionally, although not directly related to the buffer over-read issue, the patch includes a minor adjustment in the way `detune` is calculated, making the code more readable and consistent without altering its functionality. 

The root cause, therefore, is the lack of a boundary check on the `loop_count` variable in the `wav_write_header` function, which the patch appropriately addresses by applying a sensible limit to ensure it stays within a safe range, preventing an over-read condition.
