The root cause of CVE-2018-19758 in the `libsndfile` library, specifically in the `wav_write_header` function of `wav.c`, relates to a heap-based buffer over-read. From the provided patch, we can deduce several aspects contributing to the vulnerability:

1. **Heap Buffer Over-read**: The vulnerability is due to reading beyond the allocated memory, which is referred to as a buffer over-read. This problem occurs when the code reads more data than it should, often due to incorrect calculations or lack of validation on the size of the buffer being accessed. This can lead to a Denial of Service (DoS) as the program crashes when trying to access memory outside of the allocated range.

2. **Improper Input Validation**: The patch introduces a line that ensures the `loop_count` field does not exceed a certain range (`psf->instrument->loop_count &= 0x7fff;`). This suggests that the original issue was partly due to inadequate validation or restriction on the size of the `loop_count`. Without proper limits, the program could attempt to process an unexpectedly large number of loops, leading to a scenario where it reads beyond the intended buffer. By performing a bitwise AND with `0x7fff`, the patch effectively limits the `loop_count` to a maximum of 32767, which is the maximum positive value for a signed 16-bit integer. This change prevents an integer overflow or an undesirably large loop count that could cause the program to access beyond the allocated heap memory.

3. **Correcting Integer Overflows or Underflows**: While the explicit cause of the buffer over-read isn't directly pointed out by a single line change, the adjustments made in the patch, such as proper handling of data types and values (`psf->instrument->detune` calculation), signify an effort to correct or mitigate instances where overflows or improper value handling could lead to unexpected behavior, like reading outside allocated memory. 

In summary, the vulnerability was due to a combination of not properly validating input values (e.g., `loop_count`) and possibly other factors not entirely clear from the patch alone but inferred from the changes, such as issues with integer values handling that could lead to buffer over-reads. By imposing a sensible limit on `loop_count` and adjusting how other variables are handled, the patch aims to prevent scenarios where the code could attempt to read beyond the allocated heap memory, thus addressing the buffer over-read vulnerability.
