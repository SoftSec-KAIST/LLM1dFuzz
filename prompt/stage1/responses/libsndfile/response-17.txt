The root cause of CVE-2018-19758 stems from a heap-based buffer over-read in the `wav_write_header` function within the `wav.c` file in libsndfile version 1.0.28. This vulnerability could lead to a denial of service (DoS) when a specially crafted input file is processed by the library.

Analyzing the patch provided, we can observe that the developers introduced a specific change to address this vulnerability. They added a line of code in the `wav_write_header` function to limit the range of the `loop_count` variable:

```c
psf->instrument->loop_count &= 0x7fff;
```

This line ensures that the `loop_count` variable, which is a signed 16-bit number, is restricted to a "sensible" range. By applying a bitwise AND with `0x7FFF`, the value of `loop_count` cannot exceed the maximum value for a signed 16-bit integer, effectively preventing an overflow. This overflow could have led to reading beyond the allocated heap buffer when writing WAV file headers, especially when dealing with improperly formatted or maliciously crafted files.

The root cause, therefore, is the program previously not enforcing a safe range for values like `loop_count`, which when exceeding expected bounds, could result in out-of-bounds reads. This issue is a classic example of how incorrect handling of input values and lack of proper validations can lead to security vulnerabilities such as buffer over-reads, which in turn can crash the program (denial of service) or possibly lead to further exploitation depending on the context of the bug and memory layout at the time of exploitation.
