Based on the provided information about CVE-2019-7310 and analyzing the description and the subsequent patch, it can be deduced that the root cause of the vulnerability is an integer signedness error in the `XRef::getEntry` function within the `XRef.cc` file of Poppler version 0.73.0.

### Details

1. **Integer Signedness Error**: The vulnerability originates from an integer signedness error. In computing, signedness is an attribute of data types representing numbers in computer programs. An integer variable can be signed (capable of representing both positive and negative numbers) or unsigned (capable of representing only non-negative numbers). If an application incorrectly handles a signed integer (e.g., interpreting a negative value as a large unsigned value), it can lead to out-of-bounds reads or writes, because the program might try to access memory locations that are not valid for the array or buffer it's working with.

2. **Heap-based Buffer Over-read**: The result of this error is a heap-based buffer over-read. This means that the application reads more data from a heap-allocated buffer than it should, based on the buffer's allocated size. This operation can lead to a denial of service (application crash) or possibly allow attackers to have an unspecified impact by reading sensitive information from other memory locations or influencing the behavior of the program.

3. **Incorrect Handling of Negative Indices**: Specifically, the issue arises because the `XRef::getEntry` function did not properly handle requests for negative indices into an array (or similar data structure). Normally, array indices should be non-negative integers (0 or positive integers). However, due to the integer signedness error, negative indices were not correctly checked and could lead to attempting to access memory locations before the start of an allocated buffer.

4. **Patch Analysis**: The patch introduces a check at the beginning of the `XRef::getEntry` function. It tests if the provided index `i` is negative. If `i` is negative, the function logs an error and returns a pointer to a `dummyXRefEntry`, effectively mitigating the issue by preventing the out-of-bounds read that could occur with negative indices.

In summary, the root cause of CVE-2019-7310 is the incorrect handling of signed integers, specifically not checking for negative indices when accessing elements of a data structure in Poppler's `XRef::getEntry` function. The fix involves adding a safeguard against negative indices to ensure that all access operations are within the bounds of allocated memory, thereby preventing heap-based buffer over-reads.
