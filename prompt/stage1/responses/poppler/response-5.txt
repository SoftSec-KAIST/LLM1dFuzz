The root cause of the issue described by CVE-2019-7310 in Poppler 0.73.0 is an integer signedness error in the `XRef::getEntry` function located in `XRef.cc`. This error occurs because the function did not properly handle cases where it was passed a negative index value. Due to this oversight, a crafted PDF document could cause a heap-based buffer over-read. This vulnerability could be exploited by remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly have other unspecified impacts.

The patch provided addresses this issue by adding a check at the beginning of the `XRef::getEntry` function to immediately identify and handle any requests for negative index values. If a negative index is detected, an error is reported, and a pointer to a `dummyXRefEntry` is returned instead of attempting to access the XRef table with an invalid index. This effectively prevents the overflow from occurring because the function now safely handles cases where it is given indexes that are out of bounds in the negative direction, thereby mitigating the risk of heap-based buffer over-read errors.
