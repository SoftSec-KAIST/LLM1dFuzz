The root cause of CVE-2019-7310 in Poppler 0.73.0 is an integer signedness error in the `XRef::getEntry` function in `XRef.cc`. This error allows for a situation where a negative index could be passed to the `XRef::getEntry` function, which would then lead to a heap-based buffer over-read. This vulnerability could be exploited by remote attackers through the use of a crafted PDF document, potentially causing a denial of service (application crash) or possibly having unspecified other impacts.

The nature of the bug as an integer signedness error suggests that the code did not properly handle situations where an integer (in this case, the index `i`) might become negative. In the context of array or buffer access in C and C++ (the languages used in Poppler), negative indices are invalid and can lead to unauthorized memory access attempts, which might read sensitive information from adjacent memory locations or, as in this case, lead to crashes due to accessing non-allocated memory areas.

The patch addresses this vulnerability by specifically checking for negative index values (`i < 0`) before proceeding with the rest of the `XRef::getEntry` function. If a negative index is encountered, an error is logged, and a dummy `XRefEntry` is returned instead of proceeding with potentially dangerous memory access. This approach effectively mitigates the vulnerability by ensuring that negative indices, which could lead to buffer over-read, are no longer processed in a manner that would lead to unsafe memory operations.
