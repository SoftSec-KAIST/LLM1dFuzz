The root cause of CVE-2019-7310 lies in the "XRef::getEntry" function in the XRef.cc file of Poppler version 0.73.0. Specifically, this vulnerability is due to an integer signedness error that results in a heap-based buffer over-read.

An integer signedness error typically occurs when an integer that should be interpreted as unsigned is mistakenly treated as signed (or vice versa), leading to unexpected behavior. In this case, the error is manifesting as it allows for negative indices to be passed to the "XRef::getEntry" function. Normally, array or buffer indices are expected to be non-negative (i.e., 0 or positive) since they represent positions within the array or buffer. However, when a negative index is passed due to the signedness error, it could lead to an out-of-bounds read. This out-of-bounds read, in turn, can cause a denial of service (DoS) due to an application crash or possibly lead to other unspecified impacts when processing a maliciously crafted PDF document.

The patch addresses this vulnerability by explicitly checking for negative indices at the beginning of the "XRef::getEntry" function. If the index ('i') is found to be negative, it triggers an error and returns a reference to a "dummyXRefEntry" to safely handle the invalid request. This prevents the possibility of an out-of-bounds read since the function no longer attempts to access the entries array with a negative index. The change ensures that access is bounded to valid indices, thereby mitigating the risk of a heap-based buffer over-read and its potential consequences.
