The root cause of CVE-2019-7310 in Poppler 0.73.0 is an integer signedness error in the `XRef::getEntry` function in `XRef.cc`, which leads to a heap-based buffer over-read. 

Here's a breakdown of how the vulnerability works and what causes it:

1. **Integer Signedness Error**: The core issue stems from the handling of negative indices in the `XRef::getEntry()` function. An integer signedness error means that a variable meant to hold only non-negative values (e.g., an index into an array, which cannot be negative) is inadvertently allowed to contain a negative value. This typically happens because the variable is of a signed type rather than an unsigned type. 

2. **Heap-based Buffer Over-read**: The application attempts to read data from the heap memory space but goes out of bounds due to the negative index. This over-read can lead to a denial of service (by crashing the application) or potentially other unspecified impacts (such as leaking memory contents). 

3. **PDF Processing**: The vulnerability is triggered when processing a crafted PDF document. The nature of the vulnerability indicates that an attacker could specially design a PDF to exploit this flaw, targeting users of Poppler's PDF utilities (e.g., `pdftocairo`).

4. **The Patch**: The provided patch addresses the issue by explicitly checking for negative indices before proceeding with the remainder of the `XRef::getEntry()` function. If a negative index is detected, the function now returns a dummy `XRefEntry` and logs an error message, effectively neutralizing the threat by preventing the over-read.

A critical aspect of understanding vulnerabilities like CVE-2019-7310 lies in recognizing how seemingly minor issues, such as a signedness error, can lead to significant security implications when handling untrusted input, as is common in document parsing libraries like Poppler. The remedy often involves adding proper validation checks at the points where external input is processed, as demonstrated by the Poppler patch.
