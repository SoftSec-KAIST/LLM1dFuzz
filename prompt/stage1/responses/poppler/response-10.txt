The root cause of CVE-2019-7310 in Poppler 0.73.0 is an integer signedness error within the `XRef::getEntry` function in the file `XRef.cc`. This error results in a heap-based buffer over-read when the software processes a specially crafted PDF document. Specifically, the issue arises because the function does not adequately handle negative values of the index (`i`) that it receives as an argument. Such improper handling can lead to attempts to access elements of an array (or similar data structures) at negative indexes, which are out of bounds and do not exist, leading to reading random memory locations adjacent to the buffer's start. This out-of-bounds read can cause a denial of service (application crash) due to accessing invalid memory addresses or might potentially lead to other unspecified impacts, which can include information leaks or enabling further exploitation, depending on how the out-of-bounds data is used by the application.

The patch addresses this vulnerability by adding a check at the beginning of the `XRef::getEntry` function to specifically check if the provided index `i` is negative. If `i` is found to be negative, the function logs an error message indicating a request for an invalid XRef entry and returns a reference to a `dummyXRefEntry`, which is a safe operation preventing the out-of-bounds read. This effectively mitigates the issue by ensuring that all attempts to access the cross-reference (XRef) entries using negative indexes are safely handled, preventing any potential buffer over-read and the associated impacts described in the CVE.
