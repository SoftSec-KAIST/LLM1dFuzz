The root cause of CVE-2016-9827 appears to be related to how input from an SWF file is handled by the listswf tool in libming 0.4.7, specifically within the parsing of the Protect tag's password. The original code used the `readBytes` function to read `length` amount of data from the file into the `parserrec->Password` buffer. If an attacker crafts a SWF file with a misleading `length` value, it might lead to a buffer over-read situation. This is because `readBytes` does not ensure that the read content is a null-terminated string, potentially causing the program to read beyond the intended buffer when it interprets the data as a string.

The patch addresses this issue by changing the function used to read the password from `readBytes` to `readString`. The `readString` function is designed to read data until it encounters a null terminator, making it more appropriate for handling string data safely. This change ensures that even if a crafted SWF file has an incorrect `length` value, the read operation will stop at the first null byte, preventing a buffer over-read.

In summary, the root cause of CVE-2016-9827 is improper handling of string data from a SWF file, leading to a potential buffer over-read. The issue is fixed by using a safer method to read string data that ensures null-termination.
