The root cause of CVE-2016-9827, based on the provided information, involves a vulnerability in the listswf tool's handling of certain SWF (Adobe's Small Web Format or ShockWave Flash) file contents within libming, specifically version 0.4.7. The issue originates from how the `_iprintf` function within `outputtxt.c` interprets data from the Protect tag in SWF files.

The original code, prior to the patch, improperly handled the Protect tag's password field by reading a block of bytes equal to the length of the Protect tag (`readBytes(f, length)`). This approach does not take into account that the Protect tag's password should be treated as a string. As a result, this can lead to a buffer over-read if an attacker crafts an SWF file that contains a Protect tag with malformed or unexpected data. The buffer over-read could then lead to a denial of service (DoS) condition, as the application may attempt to read beyond the bounds of allocated memory, causing it to crash or behave unexpectedly.

The patch addresses this vulnerability by changing the way the Protect tag's password field is read and processed. Instead of reading a raw byte sequence based on the tag length, the patched version utilizes `readString(f)`, which interprets the incoming data as a string. This is a safer way to handle variable-length, null-terminated strings commonly found in files like SWF, ensuring that the program does not read past the end of the string and avoiding buffer over-read issues.

The nature of this issue suggests that the root cause is a failure to properly validate and handle user-controlled input (in this case, the content of SWF files). Such a vulnerability emphasizes the importance of correctly interpreting and processing external data, especially when dealing with formats that support complex, structured data like SWF does. Ensuring that data is correctly and safely handled according to its expected format can mitigate similar vulnerabilities.
