The root cause of CVE-2016-9827, as indicated by the provided patch, appears to be the improper handling of password data within the SWF Protect tag by the listswf tool in libming 0.4.7. Specifically, the issue lies in the way the password is read from a SWF file.

Before the patch, the password was read using `readBytes(f, length)`, which reads a specified number of bytes from the file. This approach does not properly account for the null-terminator character in strings, potentially leading to a buffer over-read when the software reads beyond the allocated buffer for the password data. This kind of buffer over-read could be exploited by an attacker providing a specially crafted SWF file, causing a Denial of Service (DoS) by crashing the application or causing it to behave unpredictably due to accessing memory beyond the intended buffer.

The patch fixes this issue by changing the method of reading the password from `readBytes(f, length)` to `readString(f)`. The `readString` function is designed to read a null-terminated string, which ensures that reading stops at the null-terminator, effectively avoiding the buffer over-read vulnerability. By treating the password as a string and ensuring it is properly null-terminated, the patch addresses the root cause of the vulnerability, improving the security of the libming software against this type of attack.
