The root cause of CVE-2016-9827 in libming 0.4.7, as indicated by the patch, lies in the improper handling of the Protect tag's password in SWF files. Originally, the function processed the Protect tag's password by reading a specified number of bytes from an SWF file (`readBytes(f, length)`) without ensuring that these bytes form a proper string. This inappropriate handling could lead to a buffer over-read when the function attempted to read beyond the actual data available if a crafted SWF file is provided by an attacker. This buffer over-read could then be exploited to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition.

The vulnerability was fixed by changing the method of reading the Protect tag's password from `readBytes(f, length)` to `readString(f)`. `readString(f)` ensures that the data being read is processed as a string, which inherently stops at a string's termination character, preventing a buffer over-read by not basing the read operation on the potentially malicious length value specified in a crafted SWF file. This change closes the path through which an attacker could exploit the vulnerability to cause a buffer over-read and, subsequently, a denial of service.
