The root cause of CVE-2016-9827 in the listswf tool of libming 0.4.7 seems to be tied to improper handling or parsing of input from SWF files, particularly in how the Protect tag's password is handled.

Originally, the Protect tag's password was read directly from the file using a certain number of bytes (`length`) without properly ensuring that those bytes form a valid, null-terminated string. This could lead to a situation where the program might attempt to read beyond the allocated buffer if the provided length did not correspond to a null-terminated string's length. This incorrect handling of the input data could result in a buffer over-read, potentially causing a denial of service (DoS) if the program crashes or operates unexpectedly due to accessing memory outside of the intended buffer.

The patch addresses this issue by changing how the password is read from the file. Instead of reading a fixed number of bytes destined for the buffer—which does not ensure the termination of a string—the patch adjusts the parsing logic to read a string properly. By using `readString(f)`, it guarantees that the read operation stops at the first null character encountered, effectively ensuring that it reads valid string data that fits within the expected memory boundaries, preventing the buffer over-read vulnerability.

The change from `readBytes (f, length)` to `readString (f)` implies a shift from a direct byte reading approach to a safer string-oriented reading mechanism. This removes the assumption of the input's validity and integrity, incorporating a more defensive way of handling external input. The new approach inherently defends against buffer over-read scenarios by limiting the read operation to the actual string length, terminated by a null character, which is a common practice for handling strings in C.

In summary, the root cause was inadequate validation and handling of external input, particularly the way the Protect tag's passwords were read from SWF files. The fix corrects this by ensuring that the input is treated as a string with a definitive end, thus preventing the possibility of reading beyond the buffer's allocated limit.
