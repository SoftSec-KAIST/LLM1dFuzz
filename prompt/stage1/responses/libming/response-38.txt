The root cause of CVE-2016-9827, as indicated by the provided patch, seems to be improper handling of the Protect tag's Password data in SWF files by the `_iprintf` function in `outputtxt.c` in the `libming` library. The original code inaccurately reads the Password data as a series of bytes without proper validation or termination, potentially leading to a buffer over-read situation when processing crafted SWF files. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (DoS) by exploiting this buffer over-read scenario.

The key issue here is in how the Protect tag's Password is read from the SWF files. The original code uses `readBytes(f, length)`, which reads a direct byte stream from the file without necessarily considering NULL termination of strings or validating the content and length of the data. This behavior can lead to out-of-bounds read operations if the length is not accurately reflecting the expected data format or if there's malicious intent to exploit this flaw.

The patch corrects this issue by changing the method of reading the Password data to `readString(f)`. This method likely ensures that the data is read as a null-terminated string, which inherently adds a layer of safety by treating the incoming Password data as a string rather than an arbitrary byte array. This change would prevent the buffer over-read vulnerability by ensuring that any operation on the Password data would respect string termination, preventing the reading of memory beyond the intended buffer.

In summary, the root cause of CVE-2016-9827 is the incorrect handling of SWF file's Protect tag Password data, leading to a potential buffer over-read scenario. The fix involves changing the data reading approach to properly interpret the data as a string, adding a critical layer of safety against this type of vulnerability.
