The root cause of CVE-2016-9827 appears to be related to how the `_iprintf` function in `outputtxt.c` within the `listswf` tool of `libming` version 0.4.7 processes input from SWF files. Specifically, the issue arises from a buffer over-read vulnerability triggered by handling crafted SWF files.

Upon examining the provided patch, it seems that the issue was resolved by changing how the Protect tag's Password is parsed within the SWF file. Prior to the fix, the code used the `readBytes` function to read a sequence of bytes based on the specified length from the SWF Protect tag's Password. This approach could lead to a buffer over-read if the crafted SWF file specifies a length that exceeds the actual amount of available data, resulting in undefined behavior such as a Denial of Service (DoS) by attempting to access memory beyond the buffer's valid range.

The patch corrects this by replacing the call to `readBytes(f, length)` with `readString(f)` in the `parseSWF_PROTECT` function. The `readString` function likely reads a null-terminated string from the file, which inherently provides a more robust boundary check because it stops reading at the first null byte encountered, aligning with how strings are typically handled and stored. This change mitigates the issue by ensuring that the parsing process does not read beyond the intended buffer, effectively preventing the buffer over-read vulnerability from being exploited by specially crafted SWF files.

In essence, the root cause of CVE-2016-9827 was improper handling of input lengths for certain data extracted from SWF files, which could lead to accessing memory outside of the allocated buffer. The fix addresses this by altering the data parsing strategy to a safer method that inherently prevents over-reading the buffer.
