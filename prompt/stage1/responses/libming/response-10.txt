The root cause of CVE-2016-9827, based on the provided information, appears to be an improper handling of input data by the `_iprintf` function in `outputtxt.c` in the `listswf` tool of libming 0.4.7. Specifically, the vulnerability arises from a buffer over-read condition triggered by a crafted SWF file.

In the affected function, there seems to be an assumption that the input data, related to the Protect tag's password, will be of a specific length. However, this assumption does not correctly account for the possibility of encountering specially crafted input that violates this expectation.

The patch fixes this vulnerability by changing the way the Protect tag's password is parsed from reading a fixed number of bytes (`readBytes(f, length)`) to parsing it as a string (`readString(f)`). This modification implies that the root cause of the vulnerability is the incorrect handling of the password data as a byte array without proper validation or ensuring that the read does not exceed the buffer boundary. By switching to reading the password as a string, the parsing function naturally concludes at the null terminator, significantly reducing the risk of buffer over-read by ensuring that the reading process stops at a designed end-point, thereby preventing the out-of-bounds memory access caused by maliciously crafted SWF files. This approach inherently provides a safer mechanism for handling input data of variable length, as it relies on standard string termination rather than assuming a specific length of the input data.
