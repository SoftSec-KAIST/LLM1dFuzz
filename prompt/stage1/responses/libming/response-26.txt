Based on the provided description and the subsequent patch details for CVE-2016-9827, the root cause of the vulnerability appears to be improper handling of data from a crafted SWF file, specifically due to buffer over-reading. The vulnerability resides within the listswf tool's _iprintf function in outputtxt.c found in libming 0.4.7.

The initial vulnerability allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (DoS) by exploiting a buffer over-read scenario. This could happen when the parser attempts to read data beyond the allocated memory buffer, which may lead to a crash of the application, hence the denial of service.

The patch that fixes this vulnerability indicates that the root cause involves how the Protect tag's password from an SWF file is parsed. Originally, the code used `readBytes` to read the password data directly based on the passed `length`, without properly validating or ensuring that this would not lead to reading beyond the buffer's end. This can be particularly dangerous because based on the length value, which could be manipulated in a crafted SWF file, it might cause the application to read arbitrary memory locations beyond the intended buffer.

To mitigate this issue, the patch changes the approach to parsing the Protect tag's password by using `readString` instead of `readBytes`. The `readString` function likely includes mechanisms to ensure that only valid string data until a null-terminator or within safe bounds is read, thereby preventing the buffer over-read vulnerability. This change essentially makes the parser treat the password data as a string, ensuring that it reads the data in a safer manner that respects string termination, thus preventing an out-of-bounds read and the associated denial of service vulnerability.

The root cause, therefore, lies in the inappropriate method (`readBytes`) used for reading potentially untrusted data from a crafted SWF file without adequate boundary checks, leading to a buffer over-read. The fix entails switching to a safer parsing method that inherently protects against this kind of vulnerability.
