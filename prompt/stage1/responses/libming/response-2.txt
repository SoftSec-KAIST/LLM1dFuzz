The root cause of CVE-2016-9827 in the libming 0.4.7's listswf tool seems to lie in the improper handling of the Protect tag's password within SWF files, which potentially allows for a buffer over-read scenario. This vulnerability could be exploited by remote attackers to cause a denial of service by using specially crafted SWF files.

Looking at the provided patch, the issue was resolved by changing how the Protect tag’s password is parsed. Originally, the code used `readBytes(f, length)` to read the password data directly from the SWF file based on a specified length. This approach is prone to buffer over-read vulnerabilities if the specified length is incorrect or manipulated, as it directly uses the provided length without ensuring that the data within that length is correctly formatted or safe to access.

The patch corrects this issue by replacing `readBytes(f, length)` with `readString(f)`. The `readString` function is designed to read null-terminated strings, which inherently provides a safer way to read potentially variable-length data from the file. By reading until a null-terminator is encountered, it can help prevent over-reading past the intended buffer or reading arbitrary lengths of data specified by a potentially malicious SWF file. The change effectively mitigates the risk of a buffer over-read by ensuring that the parsing of the Protect tag’s password is bounded by string terminators, rather than relying on externally provided lengths that could lead to out-of-bounds memory access.

This change shows a fundamental improvement in the security and stability of the libming library by handling external data more cautiously, especially when dealing with user-provided or file-provided input lengths that could lead to exploitable conditions like buffer over-reads.
