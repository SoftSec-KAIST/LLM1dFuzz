The root cause of the CVE-2016-9827 vulnerability in the libming 0.4.7 _iprintf function, as mentioned, seems to be related to how the software handles the parsing of the Protect tag's password in SWF files, which could lead to a buffer over-read when a specially crafted SWF file is processed.

In the original code prior to the patch, the parsing function `parseSWF_PROTECT` incorrectly assumed that the entire length of the input file (specified by the `length` parameter) should be read as raw bytes without considering that the password should be treated as a null-terminated string. This is achieved using the `readBytes` function, which reads a specified number of raw bytes from the file. If the actual content doesn't properly end with a null byte (indicating the end of a string in C), or if malicious content is crafted to extend beyond the expected data structure, this could result in reading beyond the buffer allocated for the password data, leading to a buffer over-read. A buffer over-read might not directly crash the program but could allow an attacker to infer the content of memory that shouldn't be accessible, leading to information disclosure. In more severe cases or under certain conditions, it might contribute to a denial of service (DoS) by crashing the program due to accessing invalid memory addresses.

The patch addresses this vulnerability by changing the data reading strategy from `readBytes` to `readString`. The `readString` function is designed to read characters from the file until a null byte ('\0') is encountered, which properly indicates the end of a string in C. This ensures that any string data, including the password in the Protect tag, is safely read as a null-terminated string, thus preventing the buffer over-read vulnerability by ensuring that the reading stops at the logical end of the password string, rather than blindly copying a potentially miscalculated `length` of bytes.

In summary, the root cause of CVE-2016-9827 is improper handling of string data within the Protect tag of SWF files, which did not ensure the data was treated as null-terminated strings, potentially leading to a buffer over-read situation. The patch corrects this by ensuring that the password data is read correctly as a string, thereby mitigating the vulnerability.
