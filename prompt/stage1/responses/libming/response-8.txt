The root cause of CVE-2016-9827 appears to be related to the handling of the Protect tag in SWF files by libming's listswf tool. Specifically, the vulnerability arises from how the Password field within the Protect tag is read from the SWF file.

Prior to the patch, the code uses `readBytes` to read a specified number of bytes from the SWF file into the `Password` field, based on the `length` parameter. This approach does not ensure that the data being read is properly null-terminated or even valid string data, which could lead to a buffer over-read if the data is accessed as a string. Buffer over-reads can occur when the program reads beyond the allocated memory region, potentially leading to a denial of service (DoS) as the program may crash or behave unexpectedly when it encounters invalid data.

The patch addresses this vulnerability by replacing the `readBytes` function call with `readString`. The key difference is that `readString` specifically reads a null-terminated string from the file, ensuring that the data being read into the `Password` field is handled as a proper string. This change mitigates the risk of a buffer over-read because `readString` should only read data up to the first null terminator it encounters, which signifies the end of a string. By treating the Password as a string and ensuring it is read as such, the patch eliminates the improper handling of the Password data that could lead to a denial of service when processing a crafted SWF file.

In summary, the root cause of CVE-2016-9827 is the inappropriate handling of string data for the Password field within the Protect tag of SWF files, which could lead to buffer over-read issues. The patch corrects this by ensuring that the Password is processed as a string, thereby preventing the possibility of reading beyond the intended memory buffer.
