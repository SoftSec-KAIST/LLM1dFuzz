The root cause of CVE-2016-9827 appears to be the improper handling of the Protect tag's Password in the libming 0.4.7 software in its listswf tool. Specifically, the vulnerability was due to a buffer over-read issue that could be triggered by a crafted SWF (Small Web Format or Adobe Flash) file.

Looking at the patch provided to fix this vulnerability, we can infer that the original handling mechanism used the `readBytes` function to read the Protect tag's Password based directly on the file length (`length`). This approach did not ensure that the read operation was safe or that the content being read was indeed a string. In scenarios where the file is maliciously crafted to either not include a null terminator or include unexpected data, this could lead to reading beyond the allocated buffer. Consequently, this could cause a denial of service (buffer over-read) as the process could crash or behave unexpectedly when it attempted to process such out-of-bounds data.

The provided patch addresses this by changing the read operation from `readBytes` to `readString`. The `readString` function, as suggested by its name, is likely designed to read data as a string up to a null terminator or some other string-terminating condition. This inherently makes the reading operation safer when dealing with text or string data since it limits the read operation to the intended data, thus preventing the possibility of buffer over-read if the data does not conform to the expected format (i.e., if it does not end with a null terminator as a proper string should).

The change essentially enforces that the data is interpreted correctly as a string, providing a more resilient and safer handling of the input data. This effectively mitigates the vulnerability by ensuring that only valid, string-formatted data within the expected bounds is read and processed, preventing attackers from exploiting the previously flawed data handling mechanism to cause a denial of service through a buffer over-read scenario.
