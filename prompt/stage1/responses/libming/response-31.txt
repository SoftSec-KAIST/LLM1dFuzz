The root cause of CVE-2016-9827 appears to be related to the improper handling of data when parsing a Protect tag's password in a SWF (Small Web Format or Adobe Flash) file. Specifically, the vulnerability arises from a buffer over-read condition due to the way the original code read bytes from the SWF file.

In the original code, as highlighted in the vulnerability description and patch, the `_iprintf` function in `outputtxt.c` of the listswf tool in libming 0.4.7 improperly handled the reading of the Protect tag's password. This operation was performed by the `readBytes` function, which essentially reads a specified number of bytes from a file. When processing a crafted SWF file, this could lead to a buffer over-read, where the function attempts to read beyond the allocated data buffer. This kind of vulnerability can lead to a denial of service (DoS) attack as it may crash the application or, in some cases, could potentially lead to further exploitation if sensitive information is leaked from memory.

The root cause can be attributed to the misuse of `readBytes` for reading the password. In the context of SWF files and their structure, a Protect tag's password is better handled as a string rather than a raw sequence of bytes without proper boundaries (which can vary and may not be correctly validated when using `readBytes`).

The patch addresses this issue by replacing the `readBytes` function call with `readString` in the `parseSWF_PROTECT` function. `readString` is likely designed to read null-terminated strings, which inherently provides a boundary (the null terminator) for the read operation, preventing an over-read of the buffer. This change ensures that when a Protect tag's password is read from a SWF file, it is correctly interpreted as a string, resolving the buffer over-read vulnerability.

In summary, the root cause of CVE-2016-9827 is the improper handling of a Protect tag's password as raw bytes without adequately ensuring the read operation's boundaries, leading to a potential buffer over-read. The solution involves treating the password data appropriately as a string, thereby ensuring the read operation respects the data's natural boundary and mitigating the vulnerability.
