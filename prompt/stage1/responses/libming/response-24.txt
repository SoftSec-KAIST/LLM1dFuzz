Based on the information provided about CVE-2016-9827, including the description of the vulnerability and the patch that fixes it, we can infer that the root cause of this vulnerability is improper handling of user input leading to a buffer over-read.

The description highlights that the `_iprintf function in outputtxt.c` in libming 0.4.7 is vulnerable to a buffer over-read caused by a crafted SWF file. The critical point here is that the vulnerability is triggered by how the software processes a specific type of user input (in this case, a SWF file).

The patch provided further clarifies the root cause. It shows a change in how the software parses the Protect tag's password from a SWF file. Before the patch, the password data was read using `readBytes(f, length)`, which does not ensure that the input conforms to expected format or length constraints. This can lead to buffer over-reads if the input data (the SWF file) is crafted in a malicious way to exploit this lack of validation.

The patch fixes the vulnerability by changing the method of reading the password to `readString(f)`, a method that likely includes better handling of the input data, such as ensuring null-termination and perhaps checking for an expected maximum length. This change implies the root cause was the software's failure to properly validate and safely handle user-supplied input, leading to a potentially exploitable situation.

In summary, the root cause of CVE-2016-9827 is the unsafe handling of input data (a crafted SWF file) due to the use of a method (`readBytes`) that did not adequately check the integrity and structure of the input, subsequently leading to a buffer over-read scenario. The solution implemented addresses this by changing how the data is read and potentially validated (`readString`), mitigating the risk of exploitation.
