The root cause of CVE-2016-9827 as described in the information provided is related to how the _iprintf function in outputtxt.c in the listswf tool of libming 0.4.7 handles a specific SWF (Small Web Format or Shockwave Flash) file. Specifically, the vulnerability stems from a buffer over-read scenario where the program does not properly validate or handle the length of input data received from a crafted SWF file. This can be exploited by remote attackers to cause a denial of service (DoS) through crashing the application or affecting its availability for legitimate users.

The issue is addressed by modifying the way the Protect tag's password is parsed. The patch changes the function call from `readBytes(f, length)` to `readString(f)`. Initially, `readBytes` was used to read a sequence of bytes based on the specified `length` from the file. This could lead to reading beyond the allocated buffer if the `length` parameter derived from the SWF file was not validated properly or if the file was specifically crafted to exploit this flaw. By switching to `readString`, the parsing mechanism changes to read a string up to a terminating null byte or EOF. This implicitly handles the length and can prevent over-reading past the buffer, as strings in C are generally handled with their termination character, and functions working with strings are designed to stop reading at the end of the string.

Thus, the underlying cause was improper handling of input length and data, leading to a potential buffer over-read situation. The patch corrects this by adopting a safer way to parse and handle the input data, mitigating the risk of a denial of service attack leveraging this vulnerability.
