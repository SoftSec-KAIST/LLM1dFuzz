The root cause of CVE-2016-9827 appears to be related to how the `listswf` tool in libming 0.4.7 handles the parsing of the Protect tag's password in a SWF (Small Web Format or Adobe Flash) file. In the vulnerable version, it reads a specified number of bytes directly from the SWF file based on the provided length (`readBytes(f, length)`), without validating that this length corresponds to a properly null-terminated string or checking for the actual content's format.

This approach potentially leads to a buffer over-read situation. If an attacker crafts a SWF file with a Protect tag that specifies a length not accurately reflecting the data's format or intentionally designed to cause an error (for example, indicating a length longer than the actual data or pointing out of the bounds of legitimate data), it can result in reading beyond the memory allocated for the `Password` buffer. This can cause undefined behavior, including accessing out-of-bounds memory, leading to a Denial of Service (DoS) as the application may crash or behave unexpectedly due to parsing invalid memory contents.

The patch addresses this vulnerability by changing the method of reading the password. Instead of reading a specified number of bytes, the password is now read as a string using `readString(f)`, which likely reads the input until it encounters a null character (`\0`), indicating the end of a string. This change significantly reduces the risk of buffer over-read vulnerabilities since it no longer strictly depends on the provided length, and instead relies on standard string termination characters to determine the end of the password, ensuring that the reading process does not go beyond the intended bounds. This adjustment is a more secure way of handling potentially untrusted input from SWF files, as it respects string boundaries and avoids direct dependence on externally provided lengths that could be manipulated.
