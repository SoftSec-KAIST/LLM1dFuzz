The root cause of CVE-2016-9827 appears to be related to how the libming 0.4.7 library, specifically within the listswf tool's _iprintf function in outputtxt.c, incorrectly handles the reading of data from a SWF file. The issue specifically arises from the way the Protect tag's password is processed.

In the original code, there is a call to `readBytes(f, length);` to read `length` bytes from the input file `f`. This approach does not ensure that the data being read is properly null-terminated or even a valid string, which could result in the parsing operation reading beyond the buffer allocated for the password (buffer over-read). A buffer over-read can lead to a Denial of Service (DoS) as the application may crash when trying to access memory beyond the allowed bounds.

The patch addresses this issue by replacing the call to `readBytes(f, length);` with `readString(f);`. The `readString` function likely ensures that the data being read is treated as a string, ensuring it is null-terminated, which prevents the buffer over-read by making sure the parsing stops at the end of the string. This fix assumes `readString` is implemented to safely read strings from the file without exceeding the buffer, thereby resolving the vulnerability that allowed remote attackers to cause a denial of service through a crafted SWF file.

In summary, the root cause of CVE-2016-9827 was an improper handling of input data, specifically not ensuring that the data read from a SWF file is handled as a properly terminated string, leading to potential buffer over-reads. The patch corrects this by changing the method of reading the Protect tag's password to one that treats it as a string, thereby adding a level of safety against buffer over-read vulnerabilities.
