Based on the information provided, the root cause of CVE-2016-9827 in the listswf tool in libming 0.4.7 appears to be related to the incorrect handling of data within SWF files, specifically regarding the Protect tag's password.

In the original code, the password data associated with the Protect tag was being read using the `readBytes` function, which takes a specified number of bytes from the input file stream. However, this approach does not take into account the possibility that the length of the password string could be misrepresented or maliciously crafted in a way that could lead to buffer over-read conditions. A buffer over-read may occur when the program reads data beyond the end of the allocated buffer, potentially leading to a denial of service (DoS) as the program may crash or behave unexpectedly when it encounters unexpected data.

The patch addresses this issue by replacing the `readBytes` call with `readString`. The `readString` function likely reads characters from the file until it encounters a termination character (commonly a null character, `'\0'`), correctly handling strings of variable length. This approach inherently provides a safer way to handle potentially malformed or malicious input, as it does not rely on the length value provided by the potentially untrusted SWF file.

Therefore, the root cause of this vulnerability was the lack of proper validation and safe handling of untrusted input data, specifically, how the passwords within Protect tags in SWF files were read and processed. By changing the method of reading this data from a fixed-length byte read to a string read operation that looks for a natural termination of the input, the patch mitigates the risk of buffer over-read vulnerabilities in this context.
