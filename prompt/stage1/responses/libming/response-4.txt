The root cause of CVE-2016-9827 in libming 0.4.7, as indicated by the description and the patch, appears to be an issue with how the `listswf` tool's `_iprintf` function handles parsing of the Protect tag's password within a SWF (Small Web Format or Adobe Flash) file. Specifically, the vulnerability lies in the incorrect handling of the password data, leading to a buffer over-read situation.

In the original code, `parserrec->Password = readBytes(f, length);` indicates that the program attempts to read a sequence of bytes from the SWF file based on a specified length. This approach can lead to buffer over-read if the actual data size does not properly match the expected length, particularly when dealing with specially crafted, malicious SWF files designed to exploit this vulnerability. An attacker could leverage this flaw to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition by making the application crash or behave unexpectedly due to attempting to access memory outside the bounds of allocated buffers.

The patch corrects this vulnerability by changing the method of reading the password from reading a fixed number of bytes (`readBytes`) to reading a null-terminated string (`readString`). The modification with `parserrec->Password = readString(f);` ensures that the reading process respects the string's null termination, which more safely determines the end of the password data without relying on an externally specified length that could lead to buffer over-read scenarios.

This change effectively mitigates the risk of the buffer over-read vulnerability by ensuring that data is read in a manner that properly respects data boundaries, reducing the likelihood of a denial of service attack through crafted SWF files targeting this vulnerability.
