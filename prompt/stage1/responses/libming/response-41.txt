Based on the provided patch for CVE-2016-9827, the root cause of the vulnerability appears to be an incorrect handling of the "Protect tag's Password" in the affected listswf tool's source code. Specifically, the vulnerability stems from the original implementation's approach to processing the password associated with a "Protect" tag in a SWF file, by reading a fixed number of bytes based on the "length" parameter directly from the file without ensuring that this data is properly null-terminated or validating its content as a string. This incorrect handling could lead to a buffer over-read if the data did not conform to expected string characteristics, such as being null-terminated, leading to a Denial of Service (DoS) when attempting to process a crafted SWF file.

The patch addresses the issue by changing the method of reading the password from `readBytes(f, length)` to `readString(f)`. The `readString` function likely reads the data as a null-terminated string, which inherently provides a safer mechanism for processing user-defined input from SWF files by ensuring string termination. This change mitigates the risk of buffer over-read by enforcing that the password data is treated as a proper string during processing, thereby protecting against the specific DoS attack vector presented by specially crafted SWF files.

In summary, the root cause of CVE-2016-9827 is an unsafe method of processing potentially unsafe user input without proper validation or handling, leading to an exploitable buffer over-read condition. The provided patch fixes this issue by switching to a safer input handling method that inherently enforces necessary data validation for string processing.
