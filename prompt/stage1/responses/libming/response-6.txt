The root cause of CVE-2016-9827 appears to be related to how the libming library's `listswf` tool, specifically within its `_iprintf` function in `outputtxt.c`, handles reading data from a SWF (Small Web Format or Adobe Flash) file. The vulnerability arises from a buffer over-read condition. Buffer over-reads happen when a program reads data beyond the boundary of a buffer, which can lead to unexpected behavior, such as denial of service (DoS).

Looking deeper into the patch provided, we see changes made in the `parser.c` file within the `parseSWF_PROTECT` function. The original code called `readBytes(f, length)` to read the Protect tag's password from the SWF file, which directly takes the length of data to read from the file. If this length isn't accurately validated or is manipulated within a crafted SWF file, it could lead to reading beyond the allocated memory space (buffer over-read).

The patch fixes this issue by replacing `readBytes(f, length)` with `readString(f)`, which presumably reads a string from the file up to a null terminator or some inherent length limit, thus avoiding the direct use of possibly untrusted or manipulated length values. This method inherently mitigates the risk of buffer over-read by not relying on the `length` parameter passed to `readBytes` and instead using a safer approach to read the password string.

In summary, the root cause of CVE-2016-9827 is a buffer over-read vulnerability due to unsafe handling of untrusted length parameters when reading data from a crafted SWF file. The patch addresses this by changing the data reading approach to a safer method that does not directly depend on external length inputs.
