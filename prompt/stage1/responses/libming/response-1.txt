The root cause of the vulnerability CVE-2016-9827 in the libming 0.4.7 appears to be related to how the listswf tool, specifically within its outputtxt.c component, handles input from SWF files. Specifically, the vulnerability stems from improperly handling the data associated with the Protect tag of an SWF file.

The original code used the `readBytes` function to read a sequence of bytes based on the `length` parameter directly from the SWF file into the `parserrec->Password`. This approach might not properly account for the null-terminating character expected in strings, potentially leading to a buffer over-read scenario if the data read does not represent a properly formatted string. When the code attempts to process this data as a string—for instance, outputting it with functions assuming a null-terminated string—it could access memory beyond the intended buffer. This access beyond the buffer's end could lead to a Denial of Service (DoS) when the software crashes upon reading invalid memory, as indicated in the vulnerability description.

The patch addresses this issue by changing the method of reading data for the Protect tag's password. Instead of using `readBytes` which blindly reads a specified number of bytes, the patch changes the call to use `readString`. The `readString` function presumably reads data from the file until it encounters a null-terminating character, effectively ensuring that the data is properly handled as a string. This approach mitigates the risk of buffer over-read by ensuring that the read operation respects string boundaries, thus preventing the software from accessing memory beyond the intended limit.

In summary, the root cause was improper handling of string data from a crafted SWF file, leading to potential buffer over-read scenarios. The issue was effectively resolved by altering the data reading strategy to ensure that strings are safely and correctly terminated, reflecting proper handling of input data as strings rather than raw byte sequences.
