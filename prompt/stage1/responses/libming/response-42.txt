The root cause of CVE-2016-9827 appears to be related to how the `listswf` tool in libming 0.4.7 handles the parsing of a Protect tag's password from a SWF (Small Web Format) file. In the original code, the password is read directly from the file using the `readBytes` function based on a specified length. This approach does not ensure that the read content is a null-terminated string, and if the actual data read does not conform to expected string conventions, it could lead to a buffer over-read. 

Buffer over-read vulnerabilities occur when the software reads data past the end of the intended buffer. This can cause the program to access memory that it was not supposed to, leading to undefined behavior, including denial of service, as the software may crash or behave unexpectedly upon encountering invalid data.

The patch fixes this vulnerability by changing the method used to read the password data from `readBytes(f, length)` to `readString(f)`. The `readString` function likely ensures that the input is treated as a string, properly handling string termination with a null character, which helps in preventing buffer over-read scenarios. By treating the Protect tag's password as a string rather than an arbitrary sequence of bytes, it safeguards against reading beyond the buffer allocated for the password, thus mitigating the denial of service vulnerability described in CVE-2016-9827.

In summary, the root cause of CVE-2016-9827 is a buffer over-read vulnerability due to improper handling of the Protect tag's password data in a SWF file, which the patch addresses by ensuring the data is treated and read as a proper null-terminated string.
