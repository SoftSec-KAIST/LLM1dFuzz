The root cause of CVE-2016-9827 in the listswf tool of libming version 0.4.7 appears to be an insecure handling of data derived from a SWF (Small Web Format) file. Specifically, the vulnerability stems from how the `_iprintf` function in `outputtxt.c` processes input when parsing the Protect tag's password in a SWF file.

The issue lies in the function `parseSWF_PROTECT()` within `util/parser.c`, where the original code uses `readBytes(f, length)` to read the Protect tag's password from the SWF file. This approach is problematic because it treats the password data as a raw byte sequence without properly null-terminating the string or checking for its validity as a string, thus potentially leading to a buffer over-read situation. A buffer over-read can occur when the code reads beyond the allocated memory bounds, which could lead to a denial of service (DoS) as the application crashes when trying to access memory it's not permitted to.

The provided patch addresses this vulnerability by changing the method of reading the Protect tag's password. Instead of using `readBytes(f, length)`, the patch uses `readString(f)`, which inherently ensures that the data read is treated as a properly null-terminated string. This change mitigates the risk of a buffer over-read by ensuring that the application reads the password data in a manner that respects string boundaries.

In summary, the root cause of CVE-2016-9827 was the unsafe handling of input data from a crafted SWF file, leading to a potential buffer over-read vulnerability. This was resolved by altering the data parsing strategy to treat the password as a string rather than a raw byte sequence, thereby enforcing safer input handling practices.
