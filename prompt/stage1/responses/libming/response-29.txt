The root cause of CVE-2016-9827 appears to be related to how the libming library's listswf tool handles the processing of the Protect tag's password within SWF (Shockwave Flash) files. Specifically, the vulnerability arises from the incorrect handling of the password data, leading to a buffer over-read condition.

In the original code, the password data was being processed with the `readBytes` function, which reads a specified number of bytes from a file. This approach can be problematic if the specified length for the password data exceeds the actual data available in the SWF file, potentially causing the program to read beyond the buffer allocated for the password. This out-of-bounds read could lead to a denial of service (DoS) as the program may crash or behave unpredictably when attempting to access memory it does not have rights to.

The patch addresses this vulnerability by changing the method used to read the password data. Instead of using `readBytes`, the patch modifies the code to use `readString`, which reads characters from a file until a null terminator is encountered. This change effectively mitigates the risk of a buffer over-read because `readString` is inherently designed to read strings safely by looking for the termination character instead of relying on a potentially incorrect length value. By ensuring that the reading operation is bounded by the actual length of the string (up to the null terminator), the patch eliminates the possibility of reading beyond the allocated buffer, thereby resolving the vulnerability.

To summarize, the root cause is inadequate handling of input data (specifically, the Protect tag's password in SWF files) that could lead to a buffer over-read condition. The corrective action taken in the patch addresses this issue by changing the data reading approach to one that inherently prevents over-reading, thus protecting against the denial of service vulnerability.
