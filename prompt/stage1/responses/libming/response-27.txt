Based on the provided patch for CVE-2016-9827, the root cause of the vulnerability appears to be related to how input data is processed when handling a SWF (Shockwave Flash) file. The original code in `parseSWF_PROTECT` function in `util/parser.c` directly reads a sequence of bytes from the SWF file with `readBytes (f, length);`, using the provided length from the file without ensuring that the length value is accurate or performing adequate checks on the read operation. This could potentially allow for buffer over-read scenarios if a crafted SWF file specifies a length that goes beyond the actual data available, leading to a denial of service.

The patch addresses this issue by changing the way the password field of the Protect tag is processed. Instead of reading raw bytes based on the provided length, it now uses `readString(f);` to parse the Password. `readString` likely has built-in mechanisms for safely reading strings, such as looking for a null terminator or implementing its own length checks, thus preventing the over-read issue.

The essence of the problem was the blind trust in the input file's data, specifically the length value for a password, without sufficient validation. This issue is a common source of vulnerabilities, especially in software dealing with file parsing, where attacker-crafted files can manipulate the software's behavior. The revision corrects this by implementing a safer approach to data handling, mitigating the risk of buffer over-read vulnerabilities.
