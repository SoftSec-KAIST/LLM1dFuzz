Given the provided patch details, the root cause of CVE-2016-9827 appears to be related to how the libming library handles the parsing of the Protect tag's password in a SWF (Small Web Format or Adobe Flash) file. Specifically, the vulnerability is due to a buffer over-read issue in the `_iprintf` function within `outputtxt.c` in the `listswf` tool, which is triggered by a crafted SWF file.

The original code used the `readBytes` function to read a specified number of bytes (`length`) directly from the file into the `Password` field of a `parserrec` structure. This approach did not take into account that the data being read might not be a null-terminated string, which is a common expectation for string handling in C. Reading data this way without ensuring null termination or without properly handling the length can lead to buffer over-read scenarios. A buffer over-read occurs when the program reads beyond the allocated buffer, potentially leading to denial of service or the leakage of sensitive information from process memory.

The patch fixes this vulnerability by changing the function used to read the Protect tag's password from `readBytes` to `readString`. The `readString` function likely ensures that the data read from the file is treated as a string, properly handling its end and making sure it is null-terminated. This change prevents the buffer over-read by ensuring that any operations on the `Password` field will not exceed the bounds of the data intended for it, thus mitigating the denial of service vulnerability described.

In summary, the root cause of CVE-2016-9827 is improper handling of string data when parsing the Protect tag's password from a SWF file, which could allow for buffer over-read scenarios. The patch addresses this by ensuring the data is treated and read as a string, likely incorporating proper boundary checks and null termination to prevent the vulnerability.
