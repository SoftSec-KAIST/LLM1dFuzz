Based on the given patch to address CVE-2016-9827, the root cause of the vulnerability appears to be improper handling of the Protect tag's Password in SWF files by the listswf tool in libming 0.4.7. Specifically, the vulnerability arises from a buffer over-read condition.

In the original code, the password data within the Protect tag of an SWF file is read directly into memory using the `readBytes` function and the specified length from the SWF file. This approach assumes that the length field is accurate and does not handle cases where the length field might specify more bytes than are actually available or safe to read, leading to a buffer over-read condition. Buffer over-reads can result in undefined behavior, including crashes (denial of service) or potentially leaking memory contents.

The patch replaces the call to `readBytes(f, length)` with `readString(f)`. The `readString` function reads a null-terminated string, which is a common and safer way to handle string data as it naturally prevents reading beyond the end of the string. By switching to `readString`, the patch eliminates the reliance on the length field provided in the SWF file for this particular piece of data, mitigating the risk of a buffer over-read if the length field is manipulated by an attacker in a crafted SWF file.

In conclusion, the root cause of CVE-2016-9827 is the unsafe handling of data lengths based on untrusted input (the length field in the SWF file), leading to a buffer over-read scenario. The patch addresses this by changing the method of data extraction to a safer approach that inherently limits the potential for reading beyond the intended buffer.
