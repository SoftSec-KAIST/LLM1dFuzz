The root cause of CVE-2016-9827 appears to be incorrect handling of password data within the SWF (Small Web Format or ShockWave Flash) file by the listswf tool in libming version 0.4.7. The original code in `parseSWF_PROTECT` function attempts to read a sequence of bytes equal to the entire length of the Protect tag's data (which may include the password) directly from the file. This is done using the `readBytes` function, which likely does not appropriately handle the format of the password or the end of the password string, leading to a buffer over-read situation when parsing crafted SWF files. A buffer over-read can cause the program to access memory outside the bounds of allocated structures, resulting in undefined behavior including crashes (denial of service).

The patch addresses this issue by changing the method used to read the password data from `readBytes` to `readString`. This significant change implies that the original issue was likely caused by treating password data—which is expected to be a null-terminated string—incorrectly as a raw byte sequence without proper handling for its string nature and termination. `readString` function, presumably, correctly handles reading a null-terminated string, ensuring that only the appropriate data is read and avoiding the buffer over-read vulnerability.

Thus, the root cause of the CVE is essentially the mishandling of string data (the password) within the Protect tag of a SWF file by not properly considering its format and termination, leading to unsafe memory access operations. The patch corrects this by ensuring that password data is treated and read as a string, preventing potential buffer over-read scenarios.
