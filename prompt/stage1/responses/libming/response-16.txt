The root cause of CVE-2016-9827 appears to be a buffer over-read vulnerability in the listswf tool of libming 0.4.7, particularly in how the `_iprintf` function in `outputtxt.c` handles parsing of certain elements within SWF files. Specifically, the vulnerability is triggered when processing maliciously crafted SWF files.

From the patch provided, itâ€™s clear that the crux of the issue lies in the handling of the Protect tag's Password field. In the original code, `readBytes(f, length)` was used to parse the Password field of the Protect tag. This function directly reads a sequence of bytes based on the specified length from the SWF file. If the length parameter is manipulated within a crafted SWF file, it could lead to a buffer over-read, where the program tries to read more data than is present or allocated for the operation. This is because `readBytes` does not ensure that the length of the byte sequence corresponds to a proper string or checks for a null terminator, potentially leading to the process reading beyond the buffer's allocated memory, which is a common cause of denial of service (DoS) vulnerabilities.

The patch corrects this vulnerability by replacing the call to `readBytes(f, length)` with `readString(f)`, a function presumably designed to safely parse strings by ensuring that only valid string data (ending with a null terminator) is read, thus preventing the buffer over-read condition. `readString(f)` likely incorporates mechanisms to handle varying lengths safely and stops reading when it encounters a string terminator or reaches a maximum length, effectively mitigating the risk of reading beyond the buffer's boundary.

In summary, the root cause of CVE-2016-9827 is how the Protect tag's Password is parsed in libming 0.4.7. The vulnerability stems from using a potentially unsafe method (`readBytes`) that allows for a buffer over-read condition when handling specially crafted SWF files. This condition was fixed by employing a safer parsing function (`readString`) that ensures only valid, properly terminated string data is read, thereby preventing the over-read and addressing the denial of service vulnerability.
