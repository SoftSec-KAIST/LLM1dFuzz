The root cause of CVE-2016-9827 appears to be related to the way the `listswf` tool from libming 0.4.7 handles SWF (Small Web Format or Adobe Flash) files, particularly in how it reads the Protect tag's password from these files. The vulnerability stems from a buffer over-read condition, which is a type of software bug that occurs when the program reads data beyond the allocated buffer. This can lead to crashes (denial of service) or even potentially allow an attacker to read sensitive information from memory.

In the original code, the password is read using the `readBytes` function with the length determined by the SWF file itself. This approach does not account for the possibility that the length might lead to reading beyond the allocated buffer, which can be exploited by remote attackers through a crafted SWF file.

The patch addresses this issue by changing the method of reading the Protect tag's password from using `readBytes(f, length)` to `readString(f)`. The `readString` function likely reads the data as a string up to a terminating character (commonly NULL in C programming), making it safer in terms of preventing buffer over-read as it does not rely on the length specified in the SWF file itself. This change ensures that the operation does not go beyond the intended buffer, thereby mitigating the risk of a denial-of-service attack as described in the vulnerability.

Overall, the root cause of CVE-2016-9827 is a faulty method of reading data from a SWF file, which does not adequately protect against buffer over-read scenarios. The patch corrects this by replacing a fixed-length read operation with a safer string reading mechanism.
