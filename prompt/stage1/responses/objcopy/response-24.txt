The root cause of CVE-2017-8393 is an incorrect assumption in the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library, specifically within the code handling `objcopy` and `strip` operations, that sections of type SHT_REL/SHR_RELA (used for relocation information within ELF binaries) are always named starting with a `.rel` or `.rela` prefix. This assumption led to a global buffer over-read issue because the code did not properly handle cases where sections might not follow this naming convention, thus causing the affected programs to crash when analyzing binary files that contained unexpectedly named relocation sections.

The patch addresses this flaw by changing the behavior of how relocation sections are identified and handled. Instead of blindly assuming the names of the sections, the patched code includes new functions and modifies the interface for `elf_backend_get_reloc_section`, allowing backend functions to properly handle name mapping and avoid making unsafe assumptions about section names. This effectively prevents the buffer over-read by ensuring that the relocation sections are correctly identified and processed, irrespective of their naming.
