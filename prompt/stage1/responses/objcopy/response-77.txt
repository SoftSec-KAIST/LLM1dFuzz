The root cause of CVE-2017-8393 in the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library, as distributed with GNU Binutils 2.28, lies in improper handling of section names for `SHT_REL` and `SHT_RELA` section types. Specifically, the vulnerability arose because of an incorrect assumption within the library's code related to `objcopy` and `strip` operations. It assumed that the sections of type `SHT_REL` (for rellocation entries without explicit addends) and `SHT_RELA` (for relocation entries with explicit addends) would always be named with prefixes `.rel` and `.rela`, respectively.

This assumption led to a "global buffer over-read" error, where the code would blindly skip over assumed prefixes without verifying if they actually existed. In scenarios where section names did not conform to this assumed naming convention, it could lead to referencing memory outside of intended bounds. This could cause crashes in applications using the libbfd library to analyze binary programs, such as the `objcopy` and `strip` utilities.

The patch addresses this issue by removing the incorrect assumption and replacing it with a more robust method of determining the section to which relocation entries apply. This is achieved through changes in the `elf_backend_get_reloc_section` function and related infrastructure to ensure it no longer relies solely on section name prefixes to identify the target section of relocations. The updated code introduces a mechanism to handle name mapping more effectively and safely, thereby preventing the buffer over-read vulnerability from occurring.

The patch describes updates to several files and functions within the BFD library, indicating a comprehensive approach to eliminating the vulnerability by ensuring all backend functions that need to map relocation sections to their corresponding target sections can do so accurately and without relying on flawed assumptions about section naming conventions.
