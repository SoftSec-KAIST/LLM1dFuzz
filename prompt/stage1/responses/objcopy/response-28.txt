The root cause of CVE-2017-8393 is the incorrect assumption made by the code handling objcopy and strip in the GNU Binutils Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library, specifically libbfd version 2.28. The vulnerability stems from the code assuming that sections of type SHT_REL (relocation without addends) and SHT_RELA (relocation with addends) always have names starting with the prefixes `.rel` or `.rela`, respectively. 

This faulty assumption leads to a global buffer over-read error because when the code encounters SHT_REL or SHT_RELA sections that do not follow this naming convention, it does not correctly locate the associated section to which the relocation entries apply. As a result, when attempting to read the section's data based on the presumed name, the program accesses memory outside the bounds of the intended buffer, leading to crashes when analyzing or manipulating binary files with objcopy and strip, which rely on libbfd.

The patch addresses this issue by changing how relocation sections are associated with their target sections. The patch modifies the interface to no longer assume the section name prefix, enhancing the robustness of section matching and preventing the buffer over-read condition by ensuring that relocation sections are correctly identified based on their actual names without relying on a fixed prefix pattern. This approach allows handling of SHT_REL and SHT_RELA sections regardless of their naming, thereby correcting the vulnerability and preventing the associated crashes.
