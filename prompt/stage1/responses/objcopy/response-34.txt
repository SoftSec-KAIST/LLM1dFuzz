The root cause of CVE-2017-8393 lies in the assumption made by the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library, specifically in the handling by tools such as `objcopy` and `strip`, that sections of type SHT_REL/SHR_RELA are always named with prefixes .rel/.rela. This erroneous assumption leads to a global buffer over-read error because the code does not verify the existence or correctness of these prefixes before performing operations based on them. This vulnerability can cause crashes in applications that utilize the libbfd library for analyzing binary programs due to this unchecked assumption about section naming conventions.

The patch addresses this issue by modifying the way relocation sections are handled. It replaces the incorrect assumption with a more robust mechanism that does not rely on specific name prefixes. Instead of directly mapping the relocation sections to expected names, the patch introduces new functions and alters existing ones to properly identify the sections to which the relocations apply based on actual names without presuming a .rel/.rela prefix. This change effectively prevents the buffer over-read by ensuring that the relocation processing logic is based on verified section names rather than assumptions.

In essence, the vulnerability stemmed from an unsafe assumption about section naming conventions in binary files being analyzed. The fix mitigates the issue by removing this assumption and adopting a more flexible and secure approach to section identification, thus addressing the root cause of the vulnerability.
