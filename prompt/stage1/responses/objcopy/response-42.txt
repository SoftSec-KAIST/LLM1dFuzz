The root cause of CVE-2017-8393 involves the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library's handling of SHT_REL/SHT_RELA sections in binary files, where these sections are associated with relocation information. Specifically, the vulnerability stems from an incorrect assumption in the library that these sections always begin with a `.rel` or `.rela` prefix in their names. This assumption is hardcoded into the logic for `objcopy` and `strip` utilities, which rely on the `libbfd` library to analyze and manipulate binary files.

The library failed to properly handle cases where SHT_REL/SHT_RELA sections did not adhere to this naming convention. Instead of verifying the actual names or the sections' properties, the library prematurely expected these prefixes, leading it to mishandle the indexing and referencing of sections. This incorrect handling could cause it to perform out-of-bounds reads on the global bufferâ€”attempting to access parts of the program's data outside the intended limits, which could result in crashes or incorrect behavior of the utility programs like `objcopy` and `strip`.

The patch addresses this issue by removing the strict dependence on the `.rel`/`.rela` prefix for identifying SHT_REL/SHT_RELA sections. It introduces a more flexible mechanism for determining the section to which relocation information applies, relying on the actual section names without pre-assumed prefixes. This is achieved through modifications to the functions and data structures handling section-relocation associations, allowing for accurate and safe processing of binary files, regardless of the specific naming conventions used for relocation sections.

By modifying how relocation sections are identified and processed, and allowing for a broader range of section names, the patch rectifies the flawed assumption and mitigates the risk of buffer over-read errors, enhancing the stability and reliability of the `libbfd` library and the utilities that depend on it.
