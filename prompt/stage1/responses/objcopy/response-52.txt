The root cause of CVE-2017-8393 in the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library as distributed in GNU Binutils 2.28 is a false assumption within the libbfd code that SHT_REL (Section Header Table Relocation entries) and SHT_RELA (Section Header Table Relocation entries with Addends) sections always start with a ".rel" or ".rela" prefix in their names. This assumption fails to account for cases where SHT_REL or SHT_RELA sections are named differently, leading to a global buffer over-read vulnerability. Consequently, tools using the libbfd library, such as `objcopy` and `strip`, which perform operations on binary files and depend on correct section name handling, are susceptible to crashes when they encounter such incorrectly assumed names.

This oversight in handling section names without verifying their correctness or existence leads to buffer over-read issues. Buffer over-reads can potentially cause crashes due to accessing memory not intended to be read, depending on what resides in the memory area that is being illegitimately read. This type of vulnerability is particularly concerning in the context of binary analysis and manipulation tools like those affected in Binutils, as they are often used in build and development processes, potentially halting these processes or leading to the generation of incorrect binary artifacts if they crash.

The patch remedies this root cause by changing the logic that maps relocation sections to their target sections. It removes the direct reliance on the prefix of section names for identifying the applicable section for relocations. Instead, it introduces a more flexible mechanism by modifying and extending the `elf_backend_get_reloc_section` function interface. This enables backend-specific handling where necessary and avoids making incorrect assumptions about section names. The patch essentially enforces a more accurate mapping of relocation sections to their corresponding sections in the binary, mitigating the risk of buffer over-reads caused by incorrect section name assumptions.
