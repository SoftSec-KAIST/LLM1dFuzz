The root cause of CVE-2017-8393 in the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library, as described, stems from a flawed assumption within the libbfd codebase related to the handling of Section Header Table (SHT) relocation sections. Specifically, the vulnerability originates from the assumption that sections of types SHT_REL and SHT_RELA are always named with a .rel/.rela prefix.

This assumption is manifested in how the library functions `objcopy` and `strip` process binary files for relocation sections. When these tools encounter a relocation section, they expected its name to start with .rel/.rela. If a section did not follow this naming convention, it could lead to improper handling of the section's data, resulting in a global buffer over-read. This buffer over-read could cause the programs using libbfd to crash, as they might attempt to read beyond the bounds of their allocated buffers based on the erroneous expectation of section names.

The patch addresses this incorrect assumption by modifying the handling of relocation sections within the BFD library. It introduces changes to function prototypes and implementations, ensuring that the reliance on specific naming conventions for SHT_REL/SHR_RELA sections is removed and correctly handles sections regardless of their names. The changes involve adjusting how relocation sections are mapped back to the sections they refer to, using more robust methods that do not depend solely on the section name prefix.

In summary, the vulnerability's root cause was the incorrect assumption regarding relocation section names and the library's reliance on this convention to map relocation entries back to their corresponding sections. The fix involves a more flexible handling approach that properly identifies and processes these sections, thereby preventing the buffer over-read scenario and ensuring the stability of applications using the libbfd library.
