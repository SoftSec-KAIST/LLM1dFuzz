The root cause of CVE-2017-8393 in the GNU Binutils' Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library (libbfd) is the incorrect assumption that all SHT_REL/SHR_RELA sections' names start with a .rel/.rela prefix. This assumption is present in code used by tools such as `objcopy` and `strip`, which rely on the libbfd library for binary analysis. When encountering SHT_REL/SHR_RELA sections that do not adhere to this naming convention, the software experiences a global buffer over-read error. This is because the code expects these prefixes to exist and operates based on this expectation without proper validation, leading to a mismatch between the expected and actual data structure layouts in memory. As buffer over-read can lead to crashes, this vulnerability compromises the stability of programs using libbfd for processing binaries, potentially leading to denial-of-service conditions or potentially could be leveraged to leak sensitive information from memory.

The provided patch addresses this issue by modifying the code to not blindly rely on the section names starting with .rel/.rela. It revises function interfaces and implementations related to the retrieval and handling of relocation sections, ensuring that an erroneous assumption about section names does not lead to buffer over-read situations. Functions like `_bfd_elf_get_reloc_section` are modified or replaced to correctly identify and handle the sections to which relocations apply based on actual section names rather than assumed naming patterns. This approach mitigates the vulnerability by removing the reliance on specific naming conventions for SHT_REL/SHR_RELA sections, enabling tools like `objcopy` and `strip` to robustly handle binaries regardless of the naming schemes used for their sections.
