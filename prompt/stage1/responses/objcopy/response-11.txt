The root cause of CVE-2017-8393 in the GNU Binutils' Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library (libbfd) relates to an incorrect assumption about the naming convention of section headers for relocation data in ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) files. Specifically, the vulnerability stems from the codeâ€™s assumption that section headers for SHT_REL (relocation entries without explicit addends) and SHT_RELA (relocation entries with explicit addends) sections always start with the prefixes `.rel` or `.rela`, respectively.

This misplaced assumption led to a global buffer over-read error because the code did not correctly handle cases where SHT_REL/SHR_RELA sections did not follow this naming convention. This vulnerability could cause programs that use the libbfd library for analyzing or manipulating binary files, such as `objcopy` and `strip`, to crash. Essentially, any deviation from the expected section name format could trigger an error in how the library reads data from the binary file, leading to a buffer over-read situation.

The patch for this vulnerability addresses the issue by changing how the library determines the section to which relocation sections (`.rel` or `.rela`) apply. Instead of assuming all relocation sections follow a strict naming pattern, the revised code adds functionality to more accurately determine the target section of relocations. This is achieved by modifying and adding functions in the library to avoid skipping over the assumed `.rel`/`.rela` prefix and instead directly mapping section names to their respective relocations. The patch refactors the code to improve the handling of section names, ensuring that the library does not rely on the flawed assumption and hence mitigates the buffer over-read vulnerability.

In summary, CVE-2017-8393 was caused by an unsafe assumption about ELF section naming conventions within libbfd, which led to improper handling of relocation section names and resulted in a buffer over-read vulnerability. The provided patch fixes this by enhancing the way libbfd associates relocation entries with their target sections, regardless of the section names.
