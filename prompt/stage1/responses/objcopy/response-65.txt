The root cause of CVE-2017-8393 is the incorrect assumption in the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library, specifically as used in GNU Binutils 2.28, that SHT_REL/SHR_RELA sections (sections for relocation) are always named starting with a .rel/.rela prefix. This assumption led to a global buffer over-read error because the code does not correctly handle cases where SHT_REL/SHR_RELA sections have names that do not follow this presumed naming convention. As a result, when programs like objcopy and strip, which rely on the libbfd library to analyze binary programs, encounter such non-conforming section names, they could crash due to the over-read error.

The patch addresses this issue by changing how the BFD library determines the section to which relocation sections (SHT_REL/SHR_RELA) apply. Instead of making assumptions based purely on name prefixes, the patch redefines the functions and interfaces (e.g., `elf_backend_get_reloc_section`) to ensure that the relationship between relocation sections and their target sections is determined more reliably, without relying on the naming convention. This modification involves checking the section name more thoroughly and using backend-specific logic (if necessary) to map relocation sections to their corresponding target sections correctly, thereby avoiding the buffer over-read issue.
