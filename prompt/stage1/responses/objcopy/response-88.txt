The root cause of CVE-2017-8393 in the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library, as distributed with GNU Binutils 2.28, is attributed to a faulty assumption in the code responsible for `objcopy` and `strip` utilities. Specifically, the erroneous assumption was that sections dealing with relocation data, denoted as SHT_REL/SHR_RELA, are always prefixed with `.rel` or `.rela`. This assumption led to a global buffer over-read error, wherein the code erroneously proceeded under this invalid assumption, attempting to handle section names in a predefined manner without verifying that such sections indeed conform to the expected naming convention.

This incorrect assumption directly impacts the reliability and stability of the `objcopy` and `strip` utilities, and potentially any other utilities or applications that rely on the libbfd library for analyzing binary programs. The issue reveals a deeper matter concerning the handling of ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) section names within the BFD library's internal logic. It showcases the importance of rigorous validation and error checking when processing binary data structures that could vary or not strictly adhere to unnamed conventions.

The patch addresses this vulnerability by altering the underlying logic and assumptions about relocating sections' names. It introduces modifications to ensure that section names are handled in a more flexible and reliable manner. This is achieved by changing the parameters and functionality of related functions (e.g., `_bfd_elf_get_reloc_section` is deleted and replaced with `_bfd_elf_plt_get_reloc_section`, `elf_get_reloc_section`), allowing for a dynamic resolution of section names without predefining expectations on their prefixes. This change not only mitigates the vulnerability but also improves the robustness of the BFD library in dealing with ELF files, accommodating a wider variety of section naming schemes while preventing similar types of errors from arising in the future.
