The root cause of CVE-2017-8393 lies in the incorrect assumption within the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library, specifically in how it handled section names for SHT_REL/SHR_RELA sections. The library assumed these sections would always be named starting with the prefixes `.rel`/`.rela`. This assumption led to a vulnerability where programs analyzing binary files using libbfd, such as `objcopy` and `strip`, would encounter buffer over-read errors and potentially crash because they might attempt to access areas of memory beyond what was valid for the given section name array, leading to undefined behavior.

The patch addresses this vulnerability by changing the way section names are mapped to their corresponding relocations. Instead of blindly relying on name prefixes, the patched code dynamically determines the relationship between relocation sections and their target sections. This involves changing function prototypes, and implementing new logic that does not make hardcoded assumptions about section name prefixes. Specifically, modifications include:
- Changing the `elf_backend_get_reloc_section` function's parameters and interpretations, allowing it to handle mapping between relocation section names and their applicable target sections based on actual content rather than name prefixes.
- Introducing `_bfd_elf_plt_get_reloc_section` and `elf_get_reloc_section` functions, which include logic to correctly map relocation sections to their targets, taking into account exceptions like `.got.plt` or `.got` sections referenced in PPC (PowerPC) backend adjustments.
- Removing the assumption-centric `_bfd_elf_get_reloc_section` function, which was based on the flawed prefix assumption, and ensuring all references are updated to use the new relocation-mapping logic.

This comprehensive approach addresses the root cause by removing the reliance on potentially incorrect section name prefixes, thus mitigating the vulnerability and improving the reliability of libbfd-based tools when handling binaries with non-standard section naming conventions for relocation data.
