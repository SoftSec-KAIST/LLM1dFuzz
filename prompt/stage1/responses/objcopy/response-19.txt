The root cause of CVE-2017-8393 is an incorrect assumption in the GNU Binutils Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library (specifically libbfd) that sections related to relocation information in ELF files (denoted by SHT_REL or SHT_RELA section headers) always begin with a ".rel" or ".rela" prefix in their names. This assumption led the code in the utilities `objcopy` and `strip`, which rely on libbfd for processing binary files, to perform operations based on this expected naming convention without proper verification. When encountering ELF files where the relocation sections do not adhere to this naming convention, it could lead to a global buffer over-read error. This buffer over-read could then lead to the crashing of applications that use these utilities to analyze or process binary files.

The patch addresses this vulnerability by removing the assumption about the section name prefixes for relocation information. Specifically, it introduces changes where instead of presuming the existence of ".rel"/".rela" prefixes, the code dynamically identifies the relocation sections based on actual names and conditions, rather than on hardcoded string expectations. This is achieved by redesigning the interface of the function responsible for fetching the relocation section (`elf_backend_get_reloc_section`) to handle name mapping more flexibly and accurately. The update ensures that the actual names of sections are checked and handled appropriately, regardless of their prefixes, thereby mitigating the risk of buffer over-read errors caused by unexpected section names.
