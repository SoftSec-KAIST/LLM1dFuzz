The root cause of CVE-2017-8393 in the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library, as seen in GNU Binutils 2.28, is an incorrect assumption made by the software when handling SHT_REL/SHR_RELA sections. Specifically, the vulnerability arises because the software erroneously assumes that all SHT_REL/SHR_RELA sections are always named starting with a `.rel` or `.rela` prefix. This erroneous assumption leads to a global buffer over-read error, as the software may attempt to access or modify data outside the bounds of allocated memory based on the incorrect identification of section names.

The vulnerability manifests in utilities that use the libbfd library for analyzing binary programs, such as `objcopy` and `strip`. When these utilities process binary files that contain SHT_REL/SHR_RELA sections not adhering to the expected naming convention, the incorrect assumption about section names can lead to memory access violations. Consequently, this can cause crashes or other unintended behavior in the affected utilities, as they attempt to read beyond the limits of allocated buffers based on the specific section names they encounter.

The patch addresses this root cause by modifying the code to remove the incorrect assumption about section name prefixes. It achieves this by changing how relocation sections are identified and processed. Rather than blindly skipping over an assumed `.rel` or `.rela` prefix, the patched code includes changes to the interface for `elf_backend_get_reloc_section` and implements a new function `elf_get_reloc_section`. These modifications allow for more accurate determination of the sections to which relocation entries apply, based on the actual names of the sections, without making unfounded assumptions about prefixes. This adjustment prevents the buffer over-read error by ensuring that memory accesses occur within the appropriate bounds of allocated buffers, based on the correct identification of section names.
