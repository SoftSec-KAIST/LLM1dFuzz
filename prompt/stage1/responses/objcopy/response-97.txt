The root cause of CVE-2017-8393 in the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library distributed with GNU Binutils 2.28 is an incorrect assumption in the library's handling of ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) section names. Specifically, the vulnerability stems from the library's assumption that section names for SHT_REL and SHT_RELA (relocation sections) always start with the prefixes ".rel" and ".rela", respectively. This assumption is used in the code paths for tools like `objcopy` and `strip`, which perform operations on binary files.

When the BFD library encounters a relocation section whose name does not start with these expected prefixes, it leads to a global buffer over-read error. This occurs because the library code improperly calculates pointers or indexes into buffers based on the expectation of encountering these prefixes. As a result, it may attempt to read beyond the allocated buffer when it processes an unexpected section name, leading to a potential crash of the application using the BFD library (e.g., `objcopy`, `strip`).

The patch for this vulnerability involves several changes to ensure that the library does not blindly skip over the assumed prefix and instead correctly identifies and handles relocation sections regardless of their naming. It modifies the interface for `elf_backend_get_reloc_section` among other changes, allowing backend functions to properly handle name mapping and avoid making assumptions about section name prefixes. This makes the library more robust against varied section naming conventions and prevents the buffer over-read situation that caused the vulnerability.

In summary, the root cause of CVE-2017-8393 is the incorrect handling of section names in the BFD library, leading to a buffer over-read situation when encountering relocation sections with unexpected names. The patched solution rectifies this by removing the assumption about section name prefixes and enhancing the mechanism for locating the applicable sections for relocations.
