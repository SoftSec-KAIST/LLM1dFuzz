The root cause of CVE-2017-8393 in the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library, as outlined in the details, is due to an incorrect assumption within the library's code, specifically affecting utilities like `objcopy` and `strip`. The vulnerability is related to the handling of relocation sections, namely SHT_REL and SHT_RELA sections in ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) files. 

The crux of the vulnerability lies in the library's assumption that all such relocation sections are invariably named with a prefix `.rel` for SHT_REL sections or `.rela` for SHT_RELA sections. When the BFD library's code encounters a relocation section that does not adhere to this naming convention, it results in a global buffer over-read. This incorrect assumption and subsequent mismanagement of the buffer can lead to a crash of utilities that leverage the libbfd for analyzing binary programs, such as the mentioned `objcopy` and `strip`.

To fix this vulnerability, the patch modifies the handling of relocation sections. Through altering function interfaces and implementations, the patch ensures that the determination of the section to which relocations apply is no longer erroneously based solely on the section name's prefix. Specifically:

- The patch introduces new functions and alters existing ones to properly handle the lookup and mapping of relocation sections without relying on the flawed naming expectation. For instance, `_bfd_elf_plt_get_reloc_section` is declared to replace `_bfd_elf_get_reloc_section`, focusing more on accurate identification of the target section for relocations.
- Changes are made across several files (`elf-bfd.h`, `elf.c`, `elf64-ppc.c`, and `elfxx-target.h`) to support this more robust approach, ensuring that the assumption of `.rel` or `.rela` prefixes does not dictate the functionality.
- The patch also modifies the structure `elf_backend_data` to change the parameters and comments regarding relocation section handling, emphasizing a departure from the prefix-based identification method.

In essence, the fix addresses the buffer over-read vulnerability by rectifying the core misconception that led to the crash when analyzing binary files with non-standardly named relocation sections. By making the handling of relocation sections more flexible and removing the unsafe assumption about their names, the patch effectively mitigates the issue described in CVE-2017-8393.
