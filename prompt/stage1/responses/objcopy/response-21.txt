The root cause of CVE-2017-8393 is an assumption inherent in the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library's handling of relocation sections in ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) files. The vulnerable code incorrectly assumed that section names for SHT_REL and SHT_RELA (relocation sections) always begin with a .rel or .rela prefix. This assumption does not hold for all valid ELF files, leading to a global buffer over-read error. 

Such a buffer over-read vulnerability could allow an attacker to cause denial of service (DoS) via causing applications relying on the libbfd library, such as objcopy and strip, to crash when processing malformed or specifically crafted binary files. 

The issue lies in how relocation sections are associated with their corresponding data sections. The flawed logic was that by looking at the section name and assuming it starts with .rel or .rela, the application could then find the relevant data section. This could lead to reading out-of-bounds memory locations if a section name did not conform to these assumptions, as the code might try to access memory that doesn't belong to any valid section.

The patch addresses this by changing the approach to how relocation sections are matched with their respective data sections. It eliminates the blind skipping over the assumed .rel/.rela prefix and introduces new handling to correctly identify and relate relocation sections to their appropriate data sections without making unsafe assumptions about the section names. The patch refactors the existing code and introduces new functions to properly handle the association, adding a layer of abstraction via the `elf_backend_get_reloc_section` function. This move ensures that any backend-specific logic required to map relocation sections to data sections can be implemented in a clean and safe manner, preventing similar bugs from occurring due to incorrect assumptions about ELF structure conventions.

This patch fundamentally resolves the issue by ensuring that the logic does not rely on unsafe assumptions about section naming conventions and instead uses a more robust method to associate relocation sections with their corresponding data sections.
