The root cause of CVE-2017-8393 stems from an incorrect assumption within the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library, specifically in its handling of relocation sections in binary files. It was assumed that sections concerning relocations (SHT_REL/SHT_RELA) were always prefixed with either .rel or .rela. This assumption led to a global buffer over-read error when the library, through tools like objcopy and strip which rely on it, encountered SHT_REL/SHR_RELA sections with names not starting with the expected prefixes.

This flawed assumption could result in programs that use the libbfd library to analyze or modify binary files, such as objcopy and strip, to crash due to attempting to read beyond the allocated buffer when they processed a binary file with relocation sections named differently than expected.

The patch addresses this issue by altering the handling and expectations around the naming of relocation sections. It modifies the interface for the `elf_backend_get_reloc_section` function, removing the direct expectation of a .rel/.rela prefix in the section names. This approach allows for more generalized handling and prevents the buffer over-read condition by correctly identifying the section to which relocations apply, irrespective of their naming convention. This fix is crucial for enhancing the stability and reliability of binary analysis and manipulation tools that rely on the BFD library.
