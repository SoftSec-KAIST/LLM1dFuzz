The root cause of CVE-2017-8393 lies in the incorrect assumption within the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library, used in GNU Binutils 2.28, that all SHT_REL/SHT_RELA sections are always named with a .rel/.rela prefix. This presumption resulted in a global buffer over-read error when libbfd-adhering programs like objcopy and strip accessed relocation sections without these prefixes, potentially leading to application crashes due to attempts to read beyond the allocated buffer.

The problem stemmed from the code assuming a uniform naming convention for relocation sections, without considering exceptions or validating the existence of these prefixes before proceeding with memory accesses. This oversight indicates a lack of proper input validation and assumptions about data format that could lead to unexpected behavior when those assumptions are not met.

The provided patch addresses this issue by modifying the interface for `elf_backend_get_reloc_section`, allowing backend functions to better handle name mapping and avoid blindly skipping over assumed .rel/.rela prefix. It introduces a mechanism to look up the section the relocations apply to based on the section name, minus the .rel/.rela prefix. This change enables the handling of relocation sections regardless of whether they strictly follow the naming convention and prevents the buffer over-read by accurately identifying the target section of relocations. The fix implies an enhancement in the handling of various section names, improving the library's robustness against uncommon or unexpected section naming practices.
