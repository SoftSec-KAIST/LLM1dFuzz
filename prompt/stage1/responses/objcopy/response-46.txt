The root cause of CVE-2017-8393 involves how the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library, particularly in GNU Binutils 2.28, handles SHT_REL/SHR_RELA sections in executables. Specifically, the vulnerability arises from an incorrect assumption in the code for `objcopy` and `strip` tools, which use the libbfd library for binary analysis and manipulation. These tools mistakenly assume that sections of type SHT_REL/SHR_RELA (which are used for relocation information in ELF binaries) are always named with a prefix of `.rel` or `.rela`. 

This incorrect assumption leads to a "global buffer over-read" error. Essentially, the software tries to access memory beyond the allocated buffer because it expects to find these section names with specific prefixes. When a section does not follow this naming convention, it could cause the program to read past the buffer intended for storing section names, potentially leading to a crash. This behavior constitutes a vulnerability because it can be exploited to cause denial of service (DoS) via a specially crafted binary file that, when processed by `objcopy` or `strip`, triggers the over-read.

The patch addresses this issue by changing the behavior of how relocation sections are identified and processed. Instead of blindly relying on the section name's prefix, the patched version uses a more flexible approach. It modifies the interface for `elf_backend_get_reloc_section` to handle name mapping appropriately, removing the direct assumption about section name prefixes for SHT_REL/SHR_RELA sections. This way, the resolved section names are not assumed to have a specific format, thus preventing the over-read issue by properly handling any section name regardless of its prefix.

In summary, the root cause is the incorrect assumption regarding the naming of SHT_REL/SHR_RELA sections in ELF binaries, leading to buffer over-reads. The solution involves a code adjustment to remove this assumption and properly handle section name mappings, ensuring memory safety even when encountering unexpected section names.
