The root cause of CVE-2017-8393 in the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library, as distributed with GNU Binutils 2.28, is a flawed assumption in the handling of ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) section names for SHT_REL and SHT_RELA sections. More specifically, the vulnerable code incorrectly assumed that sections of these types would always be named with prefixes ".rel" or ".rela," respectively. This assumption led to a buffer over-read issue when the library processed ELF sections without these expected prefixes.

The buffer over-read could occur because the code did not properly validate or handle section names that did not fit its expectations. When utilities like `objcopy` and `strip`, which rely on libbfd to analyze and manipulate binary programs, encountered ELF sections whose names did not start with ".rel" or ".rela", the incorrect assumption could lead to reading data beyond the intended buffer. As a result, this could cause crashes or other unintended behavior in the affected utilities.

The patch addressed this issue by changing how the libbfd library determines the sections to which relocation sections (SHT_REL and SHT_RELA) apply. It removed the hardcoded assumption about section name prefixes and instead introduced a more flexible mechanism for mapping relocation sections to their corresponding target sections. This included modifications to the `elf_backend_get_reloc_section` function and related data structures and functions, to correctly handle relocation section names without requiring a specific prefix.

This change ensured that libbfd would handle all valid section names correctly, preventing the buffer over-read issue and improving the robustness of utilities that depend on libbfd for ELF file manipulation.
