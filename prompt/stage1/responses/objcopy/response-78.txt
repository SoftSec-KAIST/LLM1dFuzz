The root cause of CVE-2017-8393 lies in an incorrect assumption within the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library, specifically as it pertains to the handling of relocation (SHT_REL/SHR_RELA) sections in binary files. The vulnerability stems from the code assuming that the names of these sections always start with a .rel or .rela prefix. This flawed assumption can lead to a global buffer over-read error, which in turn causes crashes in applications that rely on the libbfd library to perform binary analysis, such as `objcopy` and `strip`.

The problematic assumption seems to ignore the possibility of SHT_REL/SHR_RELA sections having names that do not conform to the expected .rel/.rela prefixed naming convention. When the BFD library encounters relocation sections with unexpected names, it improperly handles memory access, resulting in an over-read situation.

To address this vulnerability, the patch modifies the handling of relocation sections by changing the way these sections are identified and processed. Instead of relying on the section names directly, the patched version adjusts the interface for the function responsible for obtaining the relocation section (`elf_backend_get_reloc_section`) to handle name mapping more effectively. This way, it eliminates the assumption that the section names must follow a specific naming convention, thereby preventing the buffer over-read condition that leads to crashes.

Furthermore, the patch includes the addition of new functions (`_bfd_elf_plt_get_reloc_section`, `elf_get_reloc_section`) and updates to existing functions, ensuring that relocation sections are correctly identified and handled based on their actual characteristics rather than their names. This comprehensive approach in the patch ensures better stability and security for applications using the libbfd library to manipulate binary files.
