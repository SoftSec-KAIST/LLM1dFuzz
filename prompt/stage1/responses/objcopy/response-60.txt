The root cause of CVE-2017-8393 in the GNU Binutils Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library is essentially a flawed assumption within the library code, specifically regarding the handling of section names for relocation sections (SHT_REL/SHR_RELA). The library assumed that these sections always begin with a .rel/.rela prefix. This assumption led to a global buffer over-read error when the libbfd-powered applications, such as objcopy and strip, encountered relocation sections not adhering to this naming convention. Consequently, this oversight could cause these applications to crash due to attempting to read beyond the allocated buffer when they blindly expected and processed names starting with .rel/.rela.

The patch addresses the issue by revising the mechanism for identifying the sections to which relocations apply. It modifies the interface and implementation of functions responsible for fetching the relevant relocation section based on section names without presuming the .rel/.rela prefix. Thus, the fix allows for correct handling of relocation sections regardless of their naming, mitigating the risk of buffer over-read errors and enhancing the robustness of the library against unexpected inputs.
