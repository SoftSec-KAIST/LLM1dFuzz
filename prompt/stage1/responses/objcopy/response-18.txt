The root cause of CVE-2017-8393 is the incorrect assumption in the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library, specifically within the GNU Binutils suite, that sections handling relocations (SHT_REL/SHR_RELA sections) are always named with a prefix of `.rel` or `.rela`. This assumption leads to a global buffer over-read error, as the code does not properly handle cases where such sections do not follow this naming convention. This vulnerability primarily affects tools that analyze binary files using the libbfd library, such as `objcopy` and `strip`, potentially causing these programs to crash due to the incorrect handling of section names. 

The patch addresses this vulnerability by changing the way relocation sections are associated with their corresponding sections by their names. It removes the hardcoded expectation for the `.rel/.rela` prefix in section names and instead updates the interface to properly handle name mappings, ensuring compatibility across different backend functions. This update mitigates the issue by dynamically determining the applicable section based on actual section names without relying on a fixed naming convention, thus preventing the buffer over-read scenario that led to crashes.
