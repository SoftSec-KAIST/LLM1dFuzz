The root cause of CVE-2017-8393 in the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library, as included in GNU Binutils 2.28, is due to an incorrect assumption made by objcopy and strip regarding the naming of sections related to relocation (SHT_REL/SHT_RELA). Specifically, the flawed logic is that these sections always start with a .rel/.rela prefix, leading to a global buffer over-read error. This incorrect assumption can cause the affected programs to crash when they are used to analyze binary programs that include relocation sections not adhering to this naming convention.

The patch addresses this vulnerability by removing the rigid assumption about the section name prefix and instead, dynamically determining the appropriate section to which relocations apply, based on the actual name of the section rather than a hard-coded prefix. This is done by modifying the interface for `elf_backend_get_reloc_section` and introducing new functions (`_bfd_elf_plt_get_reloc_section` and `elf_get_reloc_section`) that account for varied section naming and ensure that section lookups for relocations are performed accurately. This change is essential for enhancing the robustness of the BFD library against malformed or non-standard binary inputs that could otherwise lead to crashes or potentially exploitable conditions due to the buffer over-read issue.
