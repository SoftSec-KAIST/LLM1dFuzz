The root cause of CVE-2017-8393 in the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library (libbfd) as distributed with GNU Binutils 2.28 is due to an incorrect assumption in the handling of relocation sections in binary files. Specifically, the vulnerability arises from the libbfd library's assumption that sections dealing with relocations (SHT_REL/SHR_RELA sections) always start with a .rel/.rela prefix in their names. This assumption leads to a global buffer over-read error when objcopy and strip, tools that use libbfd for binary program analysis, encounter relocation sections that do not follow this naming convention.

The core issue lies in the handling of section names when determining to which section a given relocation section applies. The incorrect assumption about prefix naming can lead to the tools attempting to read beyond the buffer allocated for the section names, resulting in crashes. This vulnerability thus represents a case where developer assumptions about external inputs (in this case, section naming conventions) do not fully account for the variety of real-world data, leading to security and stability issues.

The patch provided for this issue addresses the root cause by changing how the relocation sections are matched with their corresponding sections. Instead of blindly relying on the .rel/.rela prefix, the patch modifies the interface for `elf_backend_get_reloc_section` among others, to ensure that any backend function handling name mapping does so explicitly and safely, without making assumptions about the prefix. This includes adding checks and mechanisms to handle various naming scenarios, thus preventing the buffer over-read error by correctly identifying the section to which relocations apply based on actual names rather than assumed prefixes.
