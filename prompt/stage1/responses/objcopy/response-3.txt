The root cause of CVE-2017-8393 lies in the assumption made by the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library, specifically in the context of GNU Binutils version 2.28, when dealing with objcopy and strip commands. The key issue is that the code assumed SHT_REL/SHR_RELA sections, which are sections containing relocation information in ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) files, always had names starting with a .rel/.rela prefix. 

This assumption could lead to a global buffer over-read error. In programming, a buffer over-read can happen when a program reads data past the end of a buffer, potentially leading to crashes or, in some cases, exploitation for executing arbitrary code. In this specific situation, the improper handling of section names without checking for the expected .rel/.rela prefixes in full could cause objcopy and strip utilities, which use the libbfd library for analyzing and modifying binary files, to malfunction (i.e., crash) when processing binaries with irregularly named SHT_REL/SHR_RELA sections.

The patch addresses this root cause by refining the approach to not blindly assume the .rel/.rela prefix for SHT_REL/SHR_RELA sections. Modifications include changing the parameters and functionality of the `get_reloc_section` within the library to properly handle the name mapping and identify the applicable relocation sections without making unsafe assumptions about their naming. It essentially adds better handling for the names of relocation sections, preventing the over-read issue by ensuring that names are accurately matched and processed, thereby mitigating the risk of crashing due to an incorrect assumption about section name formatting.
