The root cause of CVE-2017-8393 lies in the incorrect assumption within the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library that SHT_REL/SHR_RELA sections are always named starting with a .rel/.rela prefix. This assumption is made by certain pieces of code integral to the functionality of `objcopy` and `strip` tools, which are used for modifying and analyzing ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) files.

Such a restrictive assumption leads to a global buffer over-read error when the code encounters SHT_REL/SHR_RELA sections that do not conform to this naming convention. When the library code tries to process such sections under the false pretense that they always start with .rel/.rela, it can lead to attempts to read beyond the bounds of allocated memory buffers. This kind of vulnerability can cause crashes in applications that utilize the libbfd library for binary analysis, including, but not limited to, `objcopy` and `strip`.

The patch addresses this issue by removing the incorrect assumption and replacing it with a more robust mechanism. The patch changes the parameter and comment of `get_reloc_section` function in several files, effectively editing the way relocation sections are identified and handled. It introduces new functions and modifies existing ones to ensure that sections are not blindly assumed to have a .rel/.rela prefix, accommodating a broader range of section naming conventions without risking an over-read.

In essence, the root cause is a design flaw or an incorrect assumption in how certain ELF sections are identified based on their names, leading to a vulnerability when the reality does not match this expectation. The patch fixes this by providing a more versatile and safer approach to section identification and processing.
