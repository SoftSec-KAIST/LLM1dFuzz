The root cause of CVE-2017-8393 in the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library, as distributed with GNU Binutils 2.28, stems from an incorrect assumption in the handling of section names for relocation entries. Specifically, the vulnerability is due to the assumption that sections of types SHT_REL and SHT_RELA, which contain relocation information, always have names that start with the prefixes `.rel` or `.rela`, respectively. This assumption led to a global buffer over-read error because the code did not properly handle cases where relocation section names did not adhere to this naming convention.

The vulnerability manifests in tools like `objcopy` and `strip` that use the libbfd library to analyze and manipulate binary files. When these tools encounter a binary file with relocation sections not following the naming convention, the flawed assumption could lead to a crash due to the buffer over-read, impacting the stability and reliability of the software that relies on libbfd for processing ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) files.

The patch addresses this issue by modifying how the libbfd library identifies and handles relocation sections. Instead of making assumptions based on the section name prefixes, the patch changes the internal logic to more robustly determine the target section of the relocations, irrespective of the naming convention. It involves updates to the `elf_backend_get_reloc_section` interface and related functions to ensure that relocation sections are correctly identified and processed without relying solely on their names. This fix enhances the library's ability to handle ELF files with non-standard section naming and prevents the crashes associated with the flawed assumption.
