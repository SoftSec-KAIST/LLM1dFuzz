The root cause of CVE-2017-8393 is an incorrect assumption in the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library, specifically in the GNU Binutils 2.28, about the naming convention of SHT_REL/SHR_RELA sections. The underlying issue is that the code for the `objcopy` and `strip` tools in the libbfd library mistakenly assumed that sections of type SHT_REL/SHR_RELA always have names starting with a `.rel` or `.rela` prefix. This flawed assumption leads to a global buffer over-read error, which subsequently causes the affected programs that utilize the libbfd library to crash.

In simpler terms, when these tools tried to handle relocation sections (`SHT_REL` and `SHT_RELA`), they expected these sections' names to follow a specific pattern (starting with `.rel` or `.rela`). However, if a section didn't follow this naming convention, the tools would still proceed as if the naming assumption was true. This misalignment between expectation and reality could then cause the tools to read beyond the buffer allocated for the section names, leading to a buffer over-read issue.

The patch addresses this flaw by modifying the handling of relocation section names. Instead of making an absolute assumption about the section names' prefixes, the patch introduces more flexible handling. It changes the interface for the function `elf_backend_get_reloc_section`, allowing any backend function to properly handle the name mapping without making hard-coded assumptions about the prefix. This approach helps to accurately identify the section associated with a given set of relocations, regardless of whether its name follows the expected prefix pattern.

Additionally, new functions (`_bfd_elf_plt_get_reloc_section` and `elf_get_reloc_section`) are introduced to facilitate these adjustments, ensuring that relocations are correctly mapped to their corresponding sections without blindly relying on the flawed naming convention assumption. This fix, therefore, mitigates the vulnerability by correctly handling a wider range of section names and prevents the over-read error that could lead to crashes.
