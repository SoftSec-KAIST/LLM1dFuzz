The root cause of CVE-2017-8393 in the GNU Binutils Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library (libbfd) version 2.28 is an incorrect assumption in the software's handling of relocation sections in binary files. Specifically, the vulnerability stems from the software's expectation that sections of type SHT_REL (for relocatable files) or SHT_RELA (for relocatable files with explicit addends) always have names starting with the prefixes .rel or .rela, respectively.

The software uses these prefixes to identify and process relocation sections, such as those used by `objcopy` and `strip` commands for operations on binary files. This assumption leads to a global buffer over-read error. A buffer over-read occurs when the software reads data beyond the allocated buffer, which can lead to crashes or, potentially, the leakage of sensitive information if the over-read data is processed or output in some way.

The issue exposes programs that use the libbfd library for binary analysis and manipulation to crashes when they encounter binary files containing SHT_REL/SHT_RELA sections that do not adhere to the naming assumption. This could be especially problematic when processing or analyzing malformed or intentionally crafted binary files as part of automated workflows, security analysis, or reverse engineering tasks.

The patch for this vulnerability addresses the issue by updating the code to remove the rigid assumption about section naming. Instead of expecting specific prefixes, the patch revises the handling of section names, incorporating checks and logic to properly identify and process relocation sections based on their characteristics rather than their names alone. This approach enhances the robustness of the library against malformed or unconventional binaries and prevents the buffer over-read scenario described in the vulnerability.
