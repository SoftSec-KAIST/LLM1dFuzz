The root cause of CVE-2017-8393 in the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library, as detailed in GNU Binutils 2.28, is tied to an erroneous assumption within the library's handling of ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) section names for relocation information. Specifically, the vulnerability arises because the relevant code that operates during the execution of utilities such as `objcopy` and `strip` incorrectly presumes that sections of type SHT_REL (relocation entries without explicit addends) and SHT_RELA (relocation entries with explicit addends) are always prefixed with `.rel` or `.rela`, respectively. This assumption is baked into the process that maps relocation sections to their corresponding target sections in the binary file.

Relocation sections contain entries that tell the linker or loader how to modify or adjust references in the code and data segments. The naming convention for these sections often starts with `.rel` or `.rela` followed by the name of the section to which the relocations apply. For instance, `.rel.text` or `.rela.text` for relocations applying to the `.text` section. However, this is a conventional naming pattern and not a strict requirement by the ELF specification.

The faulty assumption leads to a scenario where, if a section does not follow this naming convention, the code attempting to find the target section for a given set of relocations might fail or behave unexpectedly, potentially leading to a buffer over-read issue. This is primarily because the logic attempts to strip the `.rel`/`.rela` prefix from the relocation section's name to find the corresponding target section, which fails if the section's name does not start with the expected prefix. Consequently, the programs that utilize libbfd for processing binary files, like `objcopy` and `strip`, can crash due to this flawed logic when encountering binaries with non-conventional section names for relocations.

The patch addresses this flawed assumption by changing the handling of relocation sections so that it no longer relies on the prefixed naming convention to identify the corresponding target section. Instead, it introduces modifications to allow a more flexible and reliable way to map relocation sections to their target sections, likely by directly using the section names without assuming specific prefixes. This approach alleviates the buffer over-read vulnerability by ensuring that all valid relocation sections are correctly identified and processed, regardless of their naming conventions.
