The root cause of CVE-2017-8393 lies in the incorrect assumption within the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library, specifically in how the library handles section names for SHT_REL/SHR_RELA sections. The vulnerability stems from the expectation that these section names always start with a `.rel` or `.rela` prefix. This flawed assumption can lead to a situation where the library may attempt to read beyond the allocated buffer when working with section names that do not follow this naming convention. This vulnerability affects programs and utilities that rely on the libbfd library to manipulate binary files, such as `objcopy` and `strip`, potentially causing them to crash when handling specially crafted binary files.

The patch addresses this vulnerability by changing how the library identifies the sections to which relocation entries apply. It modifies the interface for `elf_backend_get_reloc_section`, removing the reliance on the section name's prefix for identifying related sections. Instead, it ensures that the identification process is more robust and does not make assumptions based on the section name's format. This change involves several key modifications in the code, including adjustments to function parameters and comments, declaration of new functions for better handling of section names, and calling the improved function (`elf_get_reloc_section`) to correctly assign section numbers based on actual section names rather than assumed prefixes.

In summary, the root cause of CVE-2017-8393 is the assumption that SHT_REL/SHR_RELA sections always have names starting with `.rel` or `.rela`, leading to a buffer over-read vulnerability. The solution involves updating the libbfd library's code to remove this assumption and handle section name identification in a more reliable and secure manner.
