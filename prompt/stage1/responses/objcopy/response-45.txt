The root cause of CVE-2017-8393 lies in an incorrect assumption within the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library, specifically in the context of the objcopy and strip utilities' handling of ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) section names. The library erroneously assumed that sections containing relocation information (SHT_REL/SHT_RELA sections) would always have names beginning with a ".rel" or ".rela" prefix. This led to a global buffer over-read error when it encountered relocation sections that did not adhere to this naming convention. As a result, applications that relied on the libbfd library for analyzing binary programs, such as objcopy and strip, could crash due to this incorrect assumption.

The fix involved altering the way the BFD library identifies the sections to which relocations apply. Rather than blindly truncating the section name and assuming a prefixed naming convention, the patch introduces more robust handling mechanisms. This includes changing the function `elf_backend_get_reloc_section` to no longer simply skip over a presumed prefix but to instead accurately identify the section that the relocations pertain to, based on a given name stripped of its .rel/.rela prefix. This allows for flexibility in section naming and prevents the buffer over-read issue by ensuring that only valid, existing section names are referenced.

This vulnerability and its fix highlight the importance of not making rigid assumptions about input formats and the need for defensive programming practices, especially in software components used to parse and manipulate complex file formats like ELF binaries.
