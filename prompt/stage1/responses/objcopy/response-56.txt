The root cause of CVE-2017-8393 is an incorrect assumption in the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library, specifically in the libbfd component of GNU Binutils, about the naming convention of sections related to relocation entries. Specifically, the vulnerability arises from the assumption that sections of type `SHT_REL`/`SHT_RELA`, which hold relocation information, are always named starting with a `.rel`/`.rela` prefix. This flawed assumption is ingrained in the code that handles the `objcopy` and `strip` utilities, which are tools used to manipulate and analyze binary files.

When these tools, leveraging this library, encounter a section related to relocation that does not follow the naming convention assumed (i.e., not starting with `.rel` or `.rela`), a buffer over-read error can occur. This is because the code might attempt to access parts of memory that are beyond the intended buffer, based on the incorrect belief about section names. This buffer over-read can lead to crashes of the applications that rely on libbfd for processing binary files, thereby causing denial of service.

The solution, as outlined in the patch (commit `bce964aa6c777d236fbd641f2bc7bb931cfe4bf3`), involves refining the assumptions and handling of section names related to relocation. Instead of blindly skipping over an expected `.rel`/`.rela` prefix, the patched code updates the processing logic to properly handle a broader range of section names, essentially removing the incorrect assumption. This is achieved by modifying the interface and implementation in several places like `elf-bfd.h`, `elf.c`, `elf64-ppc.c`, and `elfxx-target.h` within the BFD library's codebase. The updated code introduces more robust handling mechanisms to match relocation sections to their target sections without relying on strict naming conventions, thereby addressing the root cause of the vulnerability.
