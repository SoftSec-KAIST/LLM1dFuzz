The root cause of CVE-2017-8393 is an incorrect assumption in the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library, specifically in the handling routines for `objcopy` and `strip` tools. The vulnerability arises because the library assumes that section names for `SHT_REL` and `SHR_RELA` sections (which define relocation information in ELF format) always start with the prefixes `.rel` and `.rela`, respectively. This assumption can lead to a global buffer over-read error when the library encounters relocation sections that do not conform to this naming convention. Consequently, this can cause applications that utilize the libbfd library for binary analysis or manipulation to crash due to attempting to read beyond buffer boundaries, as they rely on predictable naming patterns that are not universally applicable.

The patch to address this issue involved several key changes:
1. Modification of the `elf_backend_get_reloc_section` interface to handle name mapping more flexibly, thus allowing backends to more accurately specify how relocation sections are identified beyond the simplistic `.rel`/`.rela` prefix assumption.
2. Introduction of new functions (`_bfd_elf_plt_get_reloc_section` and `elf_get_reloc_section`) to correctly determine the target section of relocations by considering the actual section name rather than merely relying on the prefix.
3. Adjustments across multiple files (`elf.c`, `elf-bfd.h`, `elf64-ppc.c`, `elfxx-target.h`) to apply the new logic, ensuring a more robust and accurate mapping of relocation sections to their target sections.

These changes collectively correct the erroneous assumption about relocation section naming and implement a safer, more reliable mechanism for handling such sections in the context of binary manipulation and analysis tools within the GNU Binutils package.
