The root cause of CVE-2017-8393 lies in the incorrect assumption within the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library used in GNU Binutils 2.28, specifically related to how relocation sections (SHT_REL/SHR_RELA) are named. The vulnerability stemmed from the code assuming that these sections always start with a .rel/.rela prefix. This assumption caused the BFD library operations such as objcopy and strip, which rely on accurately identifying and processing section names, to mishandle sections not conforming to this naming convention. This mismanagement led to a global buffer over-read error, potentially causing the programs using the libbfd library to crash.

The patch addresses this issue by altering the handling of relocation section names. It removes the hardcoded assumption about the .rel/.rela prefix and modifies the interface of the `elf_backend_get_reloc_section` function, allowing backend functions to correctly map names. It introduces a mechanism to look up sections by their names after stripping the .rel/.rela prefix, providing a more robust and accurate way to find the sections to which relocations apply. This fix allows processing of ELF files that do not adhere to the previous naming assumptions, thus preventing the buffer over-read error and improving the stability of applications using the libbfd library for binary analysis.
