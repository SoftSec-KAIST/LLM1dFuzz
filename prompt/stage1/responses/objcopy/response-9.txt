The root cause of CVE-2017-8393 is an incorrect assumption in the codebase of the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library, particularly in tools such as `objcopy` and `strip`, which are part of the GNU Binutils package. Specifically, the vulnerability arises from the assumption that sections of types `SHT_REL` and `SHT_RELA`, which contain relocation information, are always named with prefixes `.rel` or `.rela`, respectively. 

Due to this flawed assumption, when the library encounters an `SHT_REL` or `SHT_RELA` section not starting with the expected prefixes, it leads to a global buffer over-read error. This buffer over-read can cause the analyzing programs (`objcopy`, `strip`, etc.) to crash, as they try to access memory beyond the allocated buffer while wrongly assuming the presence of a `.rel` or `.rela` prefix in the section name. 

This not only indicates a vulnerability that can be exploited under certain conditions (potentially leading to crashes and denial-of-service attacks on software that depends on libbfd for binary manipulation) but also highlights a broader issue in software development: the risk of basing logic on unfounded assumptions. In this case, the assumption about section naming conventions in ELF files leads to a vulnerability.

The patch addresses this by modifying the handling of relocation section names and removing the assumption about the prefix. It introduces new mechanisms for correctly determining the section to which a relocation section applies, thereby eliminating the buffer over-read issue. Specifically, the patch replaces the simplistic prefix check with a dynamic resolution mechanism that can correctly handle various relocation section names, ensuring stability and reliability in the processing of binary files.
