The root cause of CVE-2017-8393 is a flawed assumption within the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library, particularly in how certain parts of objcopy and strip handle SHT_REL/SHT_RELA sections. These tools, which utilize libbfd for analyzing and manipulating binary programs, assumed that sections of type SHT_REL (Relocation Entries) or SHT_RELA (Relocation Entries with Addends) always have names starting with a .rel or .rela prefix, respectively.

This assumption leads to a global buffer over-read error because if a binary contains SHT_REL/SHT_RELA sections that do not adhere to this naming convention, the tools still attempt to access these sections based on the expected names. When the actual names differ, this behavior can result in reading beyond the bounds of allocated buffers, potentially crashing the tools due to accessing invalid memory locations.

The patch addresses this assumption by changing how relocation sections are identified and handled. Rather than blindly expecting certain prefixes, the patch introduces modifications that include a more dynamic way of determining the section to which a given set of relocations applies, based on actual data rather than just name prefixes. This involves changes to function signatures and adds new functions for better managing relocation sections, alongside various other updates to ensure that relying solely on name prefixes is avoided.

In summary, the root cause was the incorrect assumption about section names for SHT_REL/SHT_RELA types, leading to erroneous memory access when this assumption did not hold true. The solution involved refining the mechanism for linking relocation entries to their corresponding sections based on more than just their names, thereby avoiding the problematic assumption and its resultant buffer over-read issue.
