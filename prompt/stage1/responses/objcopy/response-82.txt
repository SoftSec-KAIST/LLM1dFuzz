The root cause of CVE-2017-8393 in the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library, as used in GNU Binutils 2.28, is the incorrect assumption that SHT_REL/SHR_RELA sections (sections containing relocation information) are always named starting with a `.rel` or `.rela` prefix. This assumption leads to a global buffer over-read error because the software does not properly validate or handle section names that do not follow this naming convention. When utilities such as `objcopy` and `strip`, which rely on the libbfd library, encounter SHT_REL/SHR_RELA sections with non-standard names, they might attempt to read beyond the buffer allocated for the section names. This could lead to crashes in these programs as they perform binary analysis or manipulation tasks, effectively making them vulnerable to denial of service attacks.

The patch addresses this issue by modifying the way relocation sections are handled. Instead of making assumptions about the section names based on their prefixes, the patch updates the function interfaces and implementations to ensure that section names are correctly identified and processed, regardless of their naming convention. This includes changing function parameters and comments in relevant header files like `elf-bfd.h`, introducing new functions like `_bfd_elf_plt_get_reloc_section` and `elf_get_reloc_section` in `elf.c`, and adjusting targets (`elf64-ppc.c` and `elfxx-target.h`) to conform to the new handling method. This approach eliminates the reliance on naming conventions for SHT_REL/SHR_RELA sections, thus resolving the buffer over-read issue and preventing the crashes that occurred due to incorrect assumptions about section names.
