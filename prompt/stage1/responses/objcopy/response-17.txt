The root cause of CVE-2017-8393 in the GNU Binutils Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library (libbfd) version 2.28 stems from an incorrect assumption in its handling of relocation sections in ELF files. Specifically, the vulnerability arises because the code incorrectly assumes that all sections of types SHT_REL (relocations without explicit addends) or SHT_RELA (relocations with explicit addends) are always prefixed with ".rel" or ".rela". This assumption is implemented in the functionality related to `objcopy` and `strip` tools that utilize the libbfd library for binary analysis and manipulation.

The assumption is problematic because ELF section names are arbitrary strings chosen by the compiler or the programmer, and the ELF specification does not enforce this naming convention for relocation sections. Thus, when libbfd encounters a relocation section that does not start with the expected prefix, it leads to a global buffer over-read error. This error occurs because the code prematurely attempts to access memory on the basis of this incorrect assumption, without ensuring that the memory address is valid or part of a designated buffer. Consequently, this vulnerability can cause applications using libbfd for binary analysis, such as `objcopy` and `strip`, to crash, leading to a denial-of-service condition or potentially exposing sensitive information if the contents of the over-read buffer are used improperly.

The patch to fix this issue involves changes to the way relocation sections are identified and processed. Instead of assuming a naming convention, the patched code dynamically identifies the appropriate section to which the relocation applies based on actual section names without blindly stripping expected prefixes. This approach includes modifications to function interfaces and implementations, ensuring that relocation sections are handled correctly regardless of their naming. Specifically, new functions `elf_get_reloc_section` and `_bfd_elf_plt_get_reloc_section` are introduced to properly map relocation sections to their corresponding target sections, addressing the root cause by removing the flawed assumption and mitigating the risk of buffer over-read errors.
