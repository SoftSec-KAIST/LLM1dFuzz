The root cause of CVE-2017-8393 is an incorrect assumption in the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library, specifically within the handling mechanisms of the `objcopy` and `strip` utilities. This assumption is that sections of type SHT_REL/SHR_RELA (used for storing relocation information in ELF files) are always named starting with a .rel/.rela prefix.

This assumption leads to a global buffer over-read error because the code does not properly handle cases where SHT_REL/SHR_RELA sections do not follow this naming convention. In essence, the vulnerable code blindly skips over these prefixes without verifying that the section it's dealing with actually has such a prefix. This oversight means that the software could attempt to read or process data outside the bounds of its intended buffer or memory area, leading to crashes or other unintended behaviors when processing malformed or specially crafted binary files. 

The provided patch addresses this vulnerability by modifying the interface for `elf_backend_get_reloc_section` so that backend functions now only need to handle name mapping without making assumptions about section names. New functions are introduced to avoid blindly skipping over assumed prefixes and instead correctly identify the section to which relocation information applies, based on actual section names rather than assumed prefixes. This change ensures that the processing of binary files with non-standard section names for relocation information no longer leads to buffer over-read issues.
