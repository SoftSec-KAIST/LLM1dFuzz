The root cause of CVE-2017-8393 lies in an improper assumption within the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library as included in GNU Binutils 2.28. Specifically, the vulnerability stems from the assumption that sections of type SHT_REL or SHT_RELA (which denote relocation information in ELF files) are always named with prefixes `.rel` or `.rela`. The issue occurs in the code paths used by utility programs such as `objcopy` and `strip`, which leverage the libbfd library to manipulate binary files.

This faulty assumption could lead to a global buffer over-read error. Essentially, if a SHT_REL or SHT_RELA section did not follow the naming convention assumed by the BFD library (i.e., not starting with `.rel`/`.rela`), the library would improperly handle the relocation section, potentially causing the consuming applications (`objcopy`, `strip`, etc.) to crash due to accessing memory outside the bounds of allocated buffers.

The patch addresses this vulnerability by modifying the way the BFD library handles and identifies sections for relocations, removing the reliance on the section name prefix to determine the applicability of relocations. This is accomplished through changes in the `elf-bfd.h`, `elf.c`, `elf64-ppc.c`, and related files, which now include a more robust mechanism for determining the target section of relocations by examining the actual content and properties of sections rather than making assumptions based on their names. The patch introduces new functions and modifies existing ones to correctly find and associate relocation sections without depending on specific naming patterns, thus preventing the buffer over-read situation that led to the vulnerability.
