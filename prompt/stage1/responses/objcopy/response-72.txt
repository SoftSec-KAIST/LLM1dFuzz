The root cause of CVE-2017-8393 in the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library, as distributed in GNU Binutils 2.28, lies in the incorrect assumption that section names for relocation information (SHT_REL/SHR_RELA) always start with a `.rel/.rela` prefix. This assumption led to a global buffer over-read error, impacting tools like objcopy and strip that rely on the libbfd library to analyze binary programs. Specifically, when such tools encountered relocation sections not following the naming convention, they would attempt to access memory beyond the allocated buffer, resulting in a crash.

The patch addresses this vulnerability by removing the blind reliance on the `.rel/.rela` prefix to identify the section associated with relocation entries. It modifies the interface for `elf_backend_get_reloc_section`, allowing backend functions to correctly handle name mapping without making assumptions about the prefix. New functions were introduced (`_bfd_elf_plt_get_reloc_section`, `elf_get_reloc_section`), and adjustments were made to ensure that the correct section is identified and utilized by dynamically determining the relation based on the actual section names rather than a fixed prefix. This approach mitigates the issue by ensuring that the software does not read beyond the buffer when processing sections named unconventionally, thus addressing the root cause of the vulnerability.
