The root cause of CVE-2017-8393 appears to be an incorrect assumption in the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library distributed with GNU Binutils 2.28 regarding the naming of SHT_REL/SHT_RELA sections. Specifically, the code for tools such as `objcopy` and `strip`, which rely on the libbfd library for analyzing binary programs, assumed that sections dealing with relocation (SHT_REL/SHT_RELA) would always have names starting with a `.rel` or `.rela` prefix. Because of this assumption, when it encountered sections named differently, it resulted in a global buffer over-read error. 

This could lead to crashes of the aforementioned tools during binary analysis, as the incorrect handling of these differently named relocation sections could result in reading beyond the bounds of buffers. This kind of error typically leads to undefined behavior, potentially crashing the application or leading to other unintended consequences. 

The patch addressing this vulnerability modifies the way relocation sections are handled, removing the assumption about section naming and thus preventing the over-read error. By changing the `elf_backend_get_reloc_section` interface and related functions, the patch ensures that any backend function now just needs to handle name mapping without assuming that relocation sections are prefixed in a specific way. The code changes are focused on correctly identifying the sections to which the relocations apply, regardless of their names, ensuring the stability and reliability of tools using the libbfd library for analyzing binary files.
