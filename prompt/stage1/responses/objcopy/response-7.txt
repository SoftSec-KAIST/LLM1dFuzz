CVE-2017-8393 is a security vulnerability that primarily affects the GNU Binutils suite, particularly the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library, which is distributed within Binutils 2.28. The root cause of this vulnerability is an incorrect assumption in the way the BFD library, specifically utilities like `objcopy` and `strip`, handles SHT_REL/SHR_RELA sections in binary files. These sections are related to relocation information, which is crucial for resolving symbolic references to their corresponding addresses during the linking process or when modifying binaries.

The assumption at the core of this vulnerability is that the names of SHT_REL/SHR_RELA sections always start with a `.rel` or `.rela` prefix. This is a flawed presumption because not all relocation sections necessarily adhere to this naming convention, despite it being common. When `objcopy` or `strip` operates on a binary that does not follow this convention, it can lead to a "global buffer over-read" situation. This means that the software reads beyond the buffer allocated for storing the names of sections, potentially accessing and exposing sensitive information located in adjacent memory locations or causing the program to crash due to accessing an invalid memory address. 

The patch provided (commit bce964aa6c777d236fbd641f2bc7bb931cfe4bf3) addresses this vulnerability by changing the behavior of the BFD library to no longer assume that the names of SHT_REL/SHR_RELA sections start with `.rel` or `.rela`. It does so by updating the functions and structures that previously relied on this assumption. Specifically, it modifies the interface of `elf_backend_get_reloc_section` and related logic to ensure that arbitrary naming conventions can be accommodated without leading to buffer over-read errors.

In summary, the root cause of CVE-2017-8393 lies in an incorrect assumption about section naming conventions in the BFD library used by GNU Binutils, and the patch rectifies this by implementing a more flexible approach to handling section names.
