The root cause of CVE-2017-8393 stems from an incorrect assumption in the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library, specifically within the GNU Binutils 2.28, regarding the naming convention of SHT_REL/SHR_RELA sections. The library assumed that these sections always start with a `.rel` or `.rela` prefix. This assumption was made in the parts of the code that handle `objcopy` and `strip` operations. As a result of this incorrect assumption, when the libbfd library processed sections that did not follow this naming convention, it led to a global buffer over-read error. This error would likely cause the programs utilizing the library (such as `objcopy` and `strip`, which are used for manipulating binary files) to crash due to attempting to read beyond the allocated memory buffer, based on the invalid assumption about section names.

The patch for this vulnerability addresses the issue by changing the way sections are identified and processed. It eliminates the hard-coded assumption about the `.rel`/`.rela` prefix in section names. Instead, a more flexible approach is introduced where the relevant code components, including the new and modified functions in `elf.c` and adjustments to function prototypes in `elf-bfd.h`, now correctly handle relocation sections without relying on the naming convention. This involves changes to how the library maps section names to sections, ensuring that it does not blindly skip over or incorrectly process sections based on their names.

By adjusting the interface for `elf_backend_get_reloc_section` and related functions, and ensuring that section names are properly checked and not assumed to follow a specific pattern, the patch effectively addresses the root cause of the vulnerability. It prevents the over-read error by correctly handling various section names, thereby mitigating the crash issue and enhancing the robustness of the library's handling of binary file sections.
