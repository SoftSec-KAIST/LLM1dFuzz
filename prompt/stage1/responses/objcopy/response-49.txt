The root cause of CVE-2017-8393 lies in the incorrect assumption within the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library, particularly in the handling of SHT_REL/SHR_RELA sections by tools such as objcopy and strip. The faulty assumption was that these sections always have names starting with a .rel/.rela prefix. This assumption led to a global buffer over-read error, potentially causing crashes when processing binary programs with sections not adhering to this naming convention.

The vulnerability's core is the inherent risk of making assumptions about external data without sufficient validation. In this case, the assumption about section naming conventions in binary files led to unsafe memory access when the reality did not match expectations. Memory safety issues like buffer over-reads can lead to crashes or, in worse cases, could potentially be exploited to execute arbitrary code, depending on the context and other vulnerabilities present.

The patch addresses this root cause by modifying the logic to not blindly skip over and assume a .rel/.rela prefix for relocation sections. It introduces new logic to more reliably determine which section the relocations apply to, without relying solely on the section name's prefix. This change includes updating various functions and interfaces to correctly handle the section naming and retrieval process, effectively mitigating the vulnerability by removing the unsafe assumption and replacing it with a more robust mechanism for section identification.
