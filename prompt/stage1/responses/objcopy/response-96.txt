The root cause of CVE-2017-8393 was an erroneous assumption within the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library, particularly affecting GNU Binutils version 2.28. The flawed assumption was that sections of type SHT_REL/SHR_RELA within binary files always begin with a prefix `.rel`/`.rela`. This assumption led to a global buffer over-read vulnerability, which in turn caused crashes in binary analysis programs that utilize the libbfd library, such as `objcopy` and `strip`.

The vulnerability was essentially a logic error in how the library processed section names for relocation sections in ELF files. It failed to account for situations where relocation sections may not comply with the assumed naming convention, leading to incorrect memory access operations. This oversight allowed for the potential mishandling of ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) files, which could exploit this vulnerability to cause denial of service (application crashes) or potentially leak sensitive information from the memory being improperly accessed.

The patch resolved the issue by altering the function that determines which section a given relocation section applies to. Instead of assuming the section name based on prefixes, it introduced a more flexible approach that retrieves the relevant section by its actual name, removing the unsafe assumptions about naming conventions. This fix involved modifications to several files (`elf-bfd.h`, `elf.c`, `elf64-ppc.c`, and `elfxx-target.h`) to ensure that all backend functions now correctly map the name without making incorrect assumptions. The fix improved the reliability and security of the BFD library by ensuring it correctly handles ELF files with non-standard section names for relocations.
