The root cause of CVE-2017-8393 is a flawed assumption in the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library, a component of GNU Binutils, regarding the naming of relocation sections. Specifically, the issue arises because the library assumes that sections of types SHT_REL and SHT_RELA are always named with prefixes .rel/.rela. This improper assumption leads to a global buffer over-read error when the libbfd-based utilities, such as objcopy and strip, encounter relocation sections that do not adhere to this naming convention. Consequently, this vulnerability could cause these programs to crash when they attempt to process binary files with inaccurately presumed section names.

The patch addresses this vulnerability by revising the way relocation sections are identified and handled. Instead of making presumptive decisions based on section name prefixes, the patch changes the interface for the `elf_backend_get_reloc_section`, enabling backend functions to handle name mapping more accurately. New functions were introduced (`_bfd_elf_plt_get_reloc_section` and `elf_get_reloc_section`) to correctly determine the associated section without relying on the problematic naming assumption. This approach avoids the buffer over-read by dynamically identifying the correct section a relocation applies to based on actual data rather than fixed naming patterns, thereby mitigating the risk of crashes and enhancing the robustness of the library's handling of binary files.
