The root cause of CVE-2017-8393 in the GNU Binutils package, specifically in the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library libbfd, is an incorrect assumption in the handling of Section Header Table (SHT) entries related to relocation data. Specifically, the vulnerability arises due to the assumption that section names for SHT_REL/SHR_RELA (relocation entries with explicit addends and without, respectively) always start with a `.rel` or `.rela` prefix.

This assumption is flawed for several reasons:
1. **Non-Standard Section Names**: While the convention for naming these sections typically follows the `.rel` or `.rela` prefix, it is not a hard rule enforced by ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) specifications. Thus, there can be valid relocation sections in ELF files that do not adhere to this naming convention. Relying solely on the name's prefix to identify these sections can lead to situations where valid relocation information is overlooked or mishandled.
2. **Buffer Over-read**: When the code operates under this incorrect assumption, it may attempt to access part of the section name string beyond the actual end of the string. This behavior constitutes a buffer over-read, as the code may read data beyond the buffer allocated for the section name. Depending on the specific circumstances, such as the memory layout at the time of execution, this could lead to a crash due to an access violation if the read operation extends into an unmapped memory region. Alternatively, it might result in the reading of unrelated data adjacent to the buffer in memory, leading to incorrect behavior or information leaks.
3. **Crashes and Unpredictable Behavior**: Programs that analyze or manipulate binary files using libbfd, such as `objcopy` and `strip`, rely on correct interpretation of the ELF structure, including relocation sections. With the flawed assumption, these programs might crash or exhibit undefined behavior when encountering ELF files with non-standard relocation section names.

The patch addresses this issue by changing the way relocation sections are identified and handled. Rather than relying on the section name's prefix, it introduces a more flexible mechanism that does not make hard assumptions about section naming. This includes modifying the `elf_backend_get_reloc_section` function interface to support this new mechanism, aiming to correctly identify and process relocation sections regardless of their naming convention, thus mitigating the vulnerability by preventing buffer over-read scenarios and ensuring the robust handling of ELF files with non-conventional relocation section names.
