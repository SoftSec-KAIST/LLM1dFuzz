The root cause of CVE-2017-8393 in the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library, as distributed with GNU Binutils 2.28, involved an erroneous assumption in its handling of section names for relocation sections (SHT_REL/SHR_RELA). Specifically, the vulnerability arose because the library expected that the names of these sections would always start with a .rel/.rela prefix. This assumption was flawed and led to a global buffer over-read error when objcopy and strip, utilities that rely on the libbfd library, encountered relocation sections not adhering to this naming convention. This, in turn, caused these programs to crash when they processed binary files containing such atypically named sections, effectively constituting a denial of service.

The patch addressed this issue by revising the way libbfd determined the target section of relocations. Instead of making an assumption based on the section name prefix, the patch provided a more robust mechanism for identifying the applicable section, encompassing variations in naming. This was achieved by modifying internal functions and data structures to properly handle the relocation section names without presuming a strict naming pattern. 

Key changes included the removal of the direct prefix-skipping logic and the introduction of new functionality to correctly map relocation sections to their target sections, regardless of their name. Additionally, the patch improved the interface of relevant backend functions to support this flexible handling of section names. By doing so, it mitigated the risk of buffer over-read errors and the associated crashes, resolving the vulnerability described by CVE-2017-8393.
