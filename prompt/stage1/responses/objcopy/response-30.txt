The root cause of CVE-2017-8393 was an incorrect assumption in the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library, specifically within the libbfd code that handles objcopy and strip, about how SHT_REL/SHT_RELA sections are named. The vulnerability emerged because the code mistakenly assumed that these sections would always be named starting with a .rel/.rela prefix. This flawed assumption led to a global buffer over-read error, which, in turn, caused programs that rely on the libbfd library for binary analysis, such as objcopy and strip, to crash when they encountered SHT_REL/SHT_RELA sections with non-standard names.

The patch addresses the root cause by altering the behavior of the libbfd code to not blindly skip over the expected .rel/.rela prefix. It introduces a more flexible approach to identifying the sections that SHT_REL/SHT_RELA sections apply to, by changing the parameters and functionality of the `elf_backend_get_reloc_section` and related functions. Specifically, these changes allow for a dynamic determination of which section the relocations apply to, based on the actual name of the relocation section, without assuming it must have a specific prefix. This not only fixes the vulnerability but also enhances the robustness of the libbfd library in handling a wider array of section naming conventions in ELF files.
