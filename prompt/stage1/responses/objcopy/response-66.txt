The root cause of CVE-2017-8393 is an incorrect assumption in the GNU Binutils Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library (libbfd) regarding the naming conventions of sections related to relocation data (SHT_REL/SHR_RELA) in binary files. Specifically, the vulnerability arises because the code assumes that sections responsible for relocation data (used by the `objcopy` and `strip` utilities) are always named starting with a `.rel` or `.rela` prefix. This misguided assumption leads to a global buffer over-read issue where the program attempts to read beyond the allocated buffer when it encounters relocation sections not adhering to this naming convention. 

The consequence of this incorrect assumption is that utilities relying on the libbfd library for analyzing binary files, such as `objcopy` and `strip`, can crash when processing files with non-conforming section names. This crash occurs because the program fails to properly locate and handle the relocation sections, leading to out-of-bounds read operations. 

The patch addresses this root cause by altering the behavior of the code to not strictly depend on the `.rel`/`.rela` prefix for identifying relocation sections. It achieves this by changing how the library retrieves the sections to which relocations apply, thereby accommodating relocation sections without the expected prefix in their names. This fix involves updating the library's internal interface related to handling of relocation sections and modifying several functions to ensure proper identification and processing of these sections, regardless of their naming.

In summary, the root cause of CVE-2017-8393 is an assumption about section naming conventions that did not account for all valid scenarios, leading to unsafe memory access when this assumption was violated. The patch resolves this by generalizing the method for identifying applicable sections, preventing the buffer over-read error from occurring.
