The root cause of CVE-2017-8393 can be attributed to the flawed assumption in the GNU Binutils Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library, specifically within the handling of relocation sections in object files. The issue lies in the presumption that section names for SHT_REL and SHT_RELA types always begin with the .rel/.rela prefix. As such, when encountering relocation sections that do not adhere to this naming convention, the library experiences a buffer over-read error. This error occurs because the affected functions, such as those in `objcopy` and `strip`, operate under the flawed expectation, leading to improper memory access when attempting to parse and process such sections. The memory safety concern introduced by this erroneous assumption can cause crashes in applications relying on the libbfd library to analyze binary programs, potentially leading to denial of service.

The patch addresses this vulnerability by altering the way relocation sections are determined and handled. It eliminates the direct assumption about the section names by changing the mechanism to a more flexible and safer approach. This involves updating the internal API and related functions to ensure that they no longer rely solely on section name prefixes to identify related sections. Instead, the updated approach involves a more precise analysis and mapping based on the actual context and data within the binary files, thereby preventing the buffer over-read issue and enhancing the robustness of the library in handling a wider variety of binary formats.
