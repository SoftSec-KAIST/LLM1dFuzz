The root cause of CVE-2017-8393 is an incorrect assumption in the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library, part of GNU Binutils, regarding the naming of section headers related to relocation (specifically, SHT_REL and SHT_RELA sections). The affected code assumed that these sections always start with a .rel or .rela prefix. This assumption led to a global buffer over-read vulnerability because when this condition wasnâ€™t met, it could cause memory access violations. Such violations could crash applications that rely on the libbfd library for binary analysis, including commonly used tools like `objcopy` and `strip`.

The vulnerability stems from a design flaw where the logic for handling relocation sections did not account for the possibility of non-standard section names. The reliance on a naming convention without proper verification or handling of exceptions made the software susceptible to unexpected input, leading to instability and crashes under certain conditions.

The patch addresses this by changing the mechanism for handling relocation sections. It removes the dependency on the section name prefixes and introduces a more robust approach for determining the target section of relocations. This is achieved by modifying and adding functions to correctly map relocation sections to their target sections based on actual references rather than naming conventions. Moreover, the patch involves updates to various parts of the code (including `elf_backend_get_reloc_section` and related functions) to implement this new logic, ensuring that all types of section names are handled safely without presuming specific naming patterns.

This change mitigates the vulnerability by ensuring that the libbfd-based applications like `objcopy` and `strip` can handle all valid section names correctly, preventing the previous buffer over-read issue and improving the overall stability and security of the library.
