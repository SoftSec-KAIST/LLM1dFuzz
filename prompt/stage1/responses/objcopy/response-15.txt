The root cause of CVE-2017-8393 is the incorrect assumption in the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library (also known as libbfd, distributed with GNU Binutils 2.28) that sections of type SHT_REL/SHR_RELA always start with a .rel/.rela prefix in their names. This assumption leads to a global buffer over-read error when objcopy and strip, tools that rely on libbfd for binary analysis, encounter SHT_REL/SHR_RELA sections with names that do not adhere to this expected naming convention. Consequently, when such an unexpected scenario occurs, it causes these programs to crash due to attempting to read memory outside of allocated bounds.

The vulnerability arises from the way libbfd's code, designed to handle relocation sections (SHT_REL/SHR_RELA), processes section names. The original code blindly skipped over what it assumed to be a .rel/.rela prefix without verifying that the section name indeed followed this naming scheme. This oversight can lead to incorrect memory access if a section's name does not start with the expected prefix but is still processed as if it does.

To address this issue, the provided patch modifies the relevant code to eliminate the assumption about section name prefixes. Instead of presuming the .rel/.rela prefix, the patch introduces a more robust method for linking relocation sections to their corresponding target sections, regardless of their naming conventions. This is achieved by changing the functionality of locating sections to which relocations apply. Rather than deriving the target section's name by simply stripping a presumed prefix, the patch enables a direct and more flexible association between relocation sections and their target sections based on actual section names. This solution involves changes to the interface and implementation of functions responsible for this association, ensuring they no longer rely on the faulty assumption but instead handle name mapping in a generalized manner.

In summary, the root cause of CVE-2017-8393 was a flawed assumption about section naming conventions in the BFD library, leading to buffer over-reads and crashes. The fix involves removing this assumption and improving the way relocation sections are associated with their target sections.
