The root cause of CVE-2017-8393 is an incorrect assumption in the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library, as distributed with GNU Binutils 2.28, regarding the naming of certain sections within ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) files, specifically those for relocation information (SHT_REL/SHR_RELA sections). The vulnerability stems from the expectation that these sections always start with a .rel/.rela prefix in their names.

This flawed assumption leads to a global buffer over-read error when tools like `objcopy` and `strip`, which rely on the libbfd library to analyze and process binary files, encounter a relocation section whose name does not follow this expected pattern. As a result, these tools may crash due to attempting to read beyond the allocated buffer, leading to a denial of service situation or potentially exposing sensitive information if they mishandle the unexpected input.

The patch addresses this issue by modifying the code to eliminate the assumption about section name prefixes. It changes the behavior of the handling functions so they no longer rely on hardcoded .rel/.rela prefixes to identify the applicable sections for relocations. Instead, the revised approach involves more dynamic checking and handling of section names to associate relocation sections with their corresponding target sections accurately, regardless of naming conventions. This fix involves updates to several source files (`elf-bfd.h`, `elf.c`, `elf64-ppc.c`, and related headers/documentation) to ensure that section name assumptions do not lead to incorrect memory access, thereby mitigating the vulnerability.
