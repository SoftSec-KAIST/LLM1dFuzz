The root cause of CVE-2017-8393 in the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library, as identified in the GNU Binutils 2.28, is due to a global buffer over-read error. The core issue arises from the erroneous assumption that SHT_REL/SHR_RELA sections in binary files are always prefixed with .rel/.rela. This incorrect assumption manifests in the code for utilities such as `objcopy` and `strip` that leverage the libbfd library for analyzing binary programs. Essentially, when these utilities attempted to access relocation sections based on this prefix assumption, they could inadvertently read beyond the buffer's end if the section names didn't conform to the expected naming convention. This over-read could then lead to crashes in the programs utilizing libbfd for processing binaries.

The patch addresses the issue by adjusting the way relocation sections are identified and handled. It changes the interface for `elf_backend_get_reloc_section` to work with a section name stripped of the .rel/.rela prefix and subsequently maps it to the correct section in the binary file, regardless of the specific prefix. This eliminates the previous reliance on strict naming conventions for SHT_REL/SHR_RELA sections, thereby preventing the buffer over-read condition from occurring.
