The root cause of CVE-2017-8393 lies in an incorrect assumption in the implementation of the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library, specifically in how it handled SHT_REL/SHR_RELA sections, which are types of sections dealing with relocation information in ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) files.

The assumption was that these relocation sections would always be named with a prefix of `.rel` for SHT_REL sections or `.rela` for SHT_RELA sections. This assumption is manifested in the behavior of tools that use the libbfd library, such as `objcopy` and `strip`, which rely on this naming convention to process the sections accordingly.

However, there is no requirement in the ELF specification that dictates these sections must be named with these specific prefixes, leading to a scenario where, if a section did not comply with this naming convention, the libbfd-based tools would fail to correctly identify and process it. This scenario led to a global buffer over-read error, since the code would not correctly map the section name to the relocation data, attempting to read beyond the allocated memory buffer for the section name, thus potentially causing a crash due to accessing invalid memory.

The patch addresses this flaw by changing the logic used to identify the sections to which relocation information applies. It removes the hardcoded assumption about the section name prefixes and instead introduces a more flexible mechanism for mapping relocation sections to their corresponding sections in the binary file. This is done by improving the way section names are handled and by allowing for backend-specific handling of name mappings, meaning the logic can be adapted as needed for different targets without relying on incorrect assumptions about section naming conventions. 

The solution involves modifying the interface for `elf_backend_get_reloc_section`, so backend functions only need to handle name mapping. It includes new implementations that do not skip over section names based on the assumed `.rel`/`.rela` prefix, ensuring correct operation even when relocation sections do not follow the previously assumed naming convention. This fix is crucial for maintaining the stability and reliability of tools leveraging the BFD library for binary analysis and manipulation.
