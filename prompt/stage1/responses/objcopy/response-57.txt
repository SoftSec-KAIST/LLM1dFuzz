The root cause of CVE-2017-8393 involves an incorrect assumption within the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library, specifically in relation to how it handles SHT_REL/SHR_RELA sections during operations performed by utilities like objcopy and strip. The core issue is that the code assumed that the names of these relocation sections always begin with a `.rel` or `.rela` prefix. This incorrect assumption led to a global buffer over-read error because the code did not correctly handle cases where SHT_REL/SHR_RELA sections had different naming conventions. Consequently, this vulnerability could cause applications utilizing the libbfd library for binary analysis, such as objcopy and strip, to crash.

The patch addresses this flaw by modifying how the code identifies and matches the sections to which relocation entries apply. It introduces changes to the elf_backend_data structure and related functions to correctly handle the naming of relocation sections without relying on the flawed prefix assumption. Instead of blindly skipping over an assumed `.rel/.rela` prefix, the revised code dynamically identifies the appropriate section based on the actual name of the relocation section, including handling special cases like `.got.plt` sections for targets that require them. By adjusting the mechanism for linking relocation sections to their respective target sections through a more flexible and accurate name-matching process, the patch rectifies the initial misassumption and prevents the buffer over-read vulnerability from occurring.
