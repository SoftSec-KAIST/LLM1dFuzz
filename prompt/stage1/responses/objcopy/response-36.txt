The root cause for CVE-2017-8393 is the incorrect assumption in the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library, part of GNU Binutils, that SHT_REL/SHT_RELA sections (sections containing relocation information in ELF binaries) always have names starting with the prefixes .rel/.rela. This naming assumption could lead to global buffer over-read errors, as the software may attempt to access parts of memory outside the bounds of intended data structures if it encounters SHT_REL/SHT_RELA sections not adhering to the expected naming convention.

The vulnerability manifests when handling ELF files in tools such as objcopy and strip, which rely on libbfd to analyze and manipulate binary files. If these tools process an ELF file containing unusually named SHT_REL/SHT_RELA sections, the incorrect assumption could lead to an attempt to read beyond the allocated memory buffer, causing errors or crashes in the applications.

The patch addresses this issue by modifying how relocation sections are identified and handled. Instead of assuming the names of such sections, the patch entails changes to the library code to dynamically determine the sections to which relocations apply based on more reliable criteria than just name prefixes. This approach involves updating function signatures and behaviors to more accurately map relocation sections to their corresponding target sections, regardless of the naming conventions used in the binary being processed.

To be specific, the patch includes modifications in handling relocation sections, changing the interface for the `elf_backend_get_reloc_section` function, and adding new functions like `_bfd_elf_plt_get_reloc_section` and `elf_get_reloc_section`. These changes ensure that relocation sections are correctly identified and associated with their intended target sections, mitigating the risk of buffer over-reads caused by the incorrect assumptions made by the previously existing implementation.
