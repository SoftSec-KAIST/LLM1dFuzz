The root cause of CVE-2017-8393 lies in the incorrect assumption within the GNU Binutils's Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library (specifically libbfd) that relocation sections named SHT_REL/SHR_RELA always start with the prefix `.rel` or `.rela`. This assumption led to a situation where libbfd would engage in a global buffer over-read when it encountered relocation sections that did not conform to this naming convention, causing utilities relying on libbfd, such as `objcopy` and `strip`, to crash. 

The fundamental issue was the library's handling method for relocation sections, which failed to account for the variability in section naming. Instead of dynamically determining which sections relocation entries applied to based on actual section names present in the ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) files, libbfd prematurely expected specific prefixes, leading to mismatches and ultimately to buffer over-read situations when those expectations were not met.

The patch addresses this problem by modifying the internal logic of libbfd to no longer blindly assume the existence of a `.rel`/`.rela` prefix for identifying applicable relocation sections. Instead, it introduces a more flexible mechanism for matching relocation sections with their corresponding target sections. By adjusting the internal function signatures and the algorithm for finding applicable sections (`elf_backend_get_reloc_section`), the patch enables libbfd to accurately match relocation sections to their targets based on actual names rather than strict prefix requirements.

This change not only fixes the immediate buffer over-read issue (thereby addressing the vulnerability exploited by CVE-2017-8393) but also enhances the robustness of the libbfd library by making it more adaptable to variations in section naming conventions within ELF files. This improvement helps prevent similar types of vulnerabilities from arising in the future due to rigid assumptions about ELF section naming.
