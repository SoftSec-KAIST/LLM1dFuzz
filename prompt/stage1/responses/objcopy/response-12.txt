The root cause of CVE-2017-8393 in the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library, as it was before the patch, stems from an incorrect assumption in the handling of section names for relocation sections. Specifically, the vulnerability was due to the code assuming that SHT_REL/SHT_RELA sections, which are types of sections in Executable and Linkable Format (ELF) used for storing relocation information, would always have names that start with the prefix `.rel` or `.rela`. This assumption led to a situation where, if a section did not follow this naming convention, the system could perform a buffer over-read, which is an attempt to read data beyond the allocated memory buffer. This vulnerability could cause crashes in programs utilizing the libbfd library to analyze binary programs, such as `objcopy` and `strip`.

The issue was identified and addressed in the GNU Binutils 2.28 release. The patch resolved the vulnerability by altering the handling of relocation section names. Instead of making assumptions about the prefixes of section names, the patch adjusted the system to not blindly skip over assumed `.rel` or `.rela` prefixes. It involved modifying the interface for `elf_backend_get_reloc_section`, a function intended for backend handling of name mapping for sections, and implementing new functions that correctly identify the section to which relocations apply without relying on the problematic assumption.

The provided patch includes detailed modifications to multiple files (`elf-bfd.h`, `elf.c`, `elf64-ppc.c`, `elfxx-target.h`, etc.), focusing on changing how relocation sections are identified and processed. By adjusting this mechanism, the patch ensures that the system can handle sections named without the expected prefixes, thus preventing the buffer over-read scenario and enhancing the robustness of the library against similar vulnerabilities.
