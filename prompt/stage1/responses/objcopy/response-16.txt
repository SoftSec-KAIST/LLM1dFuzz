The root cause of CVE-2017-8393 can be traced back to an erroneous assumption within the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library, which is a key component of GNU Binutils. The flawed assumption was that sections handling relocation entries within object files, specifically those of types SHT_REL and SHT_RELA, always have names starting with the prefixes `.rel` or `.rela` respectively.

This incorrect assumption overlooked the possibility of differently named sections that could also contain relocation entries. As a direct consequence of this oversight, when the libbfd library, utilized by tools such as `objcopy` and `strip`, attempted to process these relocation sections, the software could attempt to access data beyond the bounds of the allocated buffers since it could not properly identify and handle the relocation entries. This condition represents a classic buffer over-read scenario, which could lead to crashes of the tools utilizing the BFD library when they perform operations on binary files containing non-standard named relocation sections.

The patch rectifies this issue by altering the behavior of `elf-backend_get_reloc_section` (and related functions) to no longer make assumptions based solely on the name prefix of relocation sections. Instead, it provides a more robust mechanism for identifying the applicable sections to which relocation entries apply. This fix ensures that relocation processing is correctly performed even when encountering sections whose names do not follow the previously expected naming convention, thereby preventing the buffer over-read scenario from occurring.
