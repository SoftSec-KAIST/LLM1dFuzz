The root cause of CVE-2017-8393 lies in the incorrect assumption made by the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library within GNU Binutils 2.28, specifically in code pertaining to `objcopy` and `strip` operations. The vulnerability is attributed to an erroneous expectation that sections of the types `SHT_REL` and `SHT_RELA` always have names beginning with a `.rel` or `.rela` prefix. This assumption can lead to a global buffer over-read because the library might attempt to access or process data based on this naming convention, which is not guaranteed to be followed by all sections. When encountering sections not adhering to this naming convention but still requiring processing according to their types (`SHT_REL` or `SHT_RELA`), the software could end up reading beyond the allocated buffer for section names, leading to crashes due to the violation of memory safety.

The patch provided tackles this issue by changing how section names are processed and matched. It introduces modifications to the functions and structures responsible for handling relocation sections, ensuring they no longer rely solely on the name prefix to associate relocation entries with their corresponding sections. The updated code includes more robust mechanisms for identifying and working with relocation sections, such as dynamically determining the target of relocation sections by their actual properties and context rather than just their name prefix. This approach prevents the buffer over-read by correctly identifying and handling sections regardless of their naming, thereby addressing the vulnerability rooted in the flawed assumption about section names.
