The root cause of CVE-2017-8393 is an incorrect assumption in the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library, specifically in the code used by utilities like `objcopy` and `strip`, which are part of GNU Binutils 2.28. This assumption was that sections of type SHT_REL/SHT_RELA (sections containing relocation information) are always named with a prefix `.rel` or `.rela`. However, not all relocation sections adhere to this naming convention, leading to a global buffer over-read error. This vulnerability can cause applications that rely on the libbfd library to analyze binary programs, such as `objcopy` and `strip`, to crash when they encounter relocation sections not following the naming convention.

The patch addresses this erroneous assumption by modifying the interface and implementation for determining the section to which a relocation section applies. It removes the direct reliance on the section's name prefix for identifying the applicable section. Instead, the patch provides a more flexible and correct approach to map relocation sections to their corresponding target sections, considering the actual use and naming variations of relocation sections across different binaries and systems. This is achieved by changing function signatures and implementations, removing the flawed assumption, and ensuring that the correct section is identified and handled without relying on a fixed naming convention.
