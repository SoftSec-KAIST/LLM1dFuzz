The root cause of CVE-2017-8393 is an incorrect assumption within the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library, particularly affecting the `libbfd` component as included in GNU Binutils 2.28. The flawed assumption was that sections handling relocation information (`SHT_REL/SHR_RELA` sections) are always named starting with a `.rel/.rela` prefix.

This assumption led to a situation where the code failed to properly handle cases where sections did not follow this naming convention. As a result, when tools like `objcopy` and `strip`, which rely on the `libbfd` library to perform operations on binary files, encountered sections that defied this naming expectation, they could experience a global buffer over-read. This buffer over-read could then cause these programs to crash, as they might attempt to read beyond the allocated memory buffer based on the incorrect assumption about section naming.

The patch addresses this issue by changing the way relocation sections are determined. Instead of blindly assuming a `.rel/.rela` prefix for sections, the code is adjusted to handle name mapping more flexibly. This involves modifications to various functions and structures to no longer make assumptions about the section names and instead ensure that the actual section to which relocations apply is correctly identified, regardless of its name. This is a more robust approach that prevents the buffer over-read by accurately identifying the target section for relocations without relying on naming conventions.

In summary, the root cause of CVE-2017-8393 was a flawed assumption about section naming conventions in the BFD library, which led to a global buffer over-read issue. The resolution involved modifying the code to accurately identify relocation sections without relying on their names, thus preventing crashes in tools using the library.
