The root cause of CVE-2017-8393 in the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library as distributed in GNU Binutils 2.28 lies in an incorrect assumption within the library's handling of relocation sections. Specifically, the vulnerability stems from the assumption that section names for SHT_REL/SHT_RELA begin with a .rel/.rela prefix. This assumption leads to a logic flaw in the library's handling of object copy (objcopy) and stripping (strip) operations.

When the libbfd library, which objcopy and strip use for analyzing binary programs, encounters a relocation section whose name does not follow this naming convention, it leads to a global buffer over-read error. This error occurs because the code does not correctly handle or anticipate section names that deviate from the expected .rel/.rela prefix pattern. As a result, when the program attempts to read or process these sections based on the faulty assumption, it can access memory outside the bounds of the intended buffer. This out-of-bounds read can cause the analyzing programs to crash, presenting a reliability issue.

The patch addresses this vulnerability by altering the way the libbfd library determines the section to which a relocation applies. It changes the approach from blindly assuming a naming convention to a more robust method that does not rely on the section name prefix. This is achieved by revising the interface for `elf_backend_get_reloc_section` and related functions, thereby ensuring they handle name mappings more dynamically and accurately, regardless of the specific naming of the sections. This correction prevents the buffer over-read error by ensuring that memory accesses are based on actual, rather than assumed, section relationships and names.
