The root cause of CVE-2017-8393 in the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library, as distributed in GNU Binutils 2.28, is an incorrect assumption in the handling of relocation section names within binary files. Specifically, the vulnerability lies in the expectation that sections of type SHT_REL or SHT_RELA (sections containing relocation information) will always have names starting with the prefixes .rel or .rela, respectively.

This assumption caused the software to misinterpret or incorrectly access sections that did not follow this naming convention, leading to a global buffer over-read error. Such a buffer over-read could occur because the software would look beyond the intended memory bounds in search of a section name matching its prefixed expectation. When the anticipated prefix was not present, it could lead to the processing of unintended memory locations, potentially resulting in crashes or other unintended behaviors in applications relying on the libbfd library, such as the `objcopy` and `strip` tools.

The patch addresses this vulnerability by altering the way relocation sections are handled. Instead of assuming that all relocation sections have names starting with .rel or .rela, the patch implements a more flexible approach. It revises the function to determine the applicable section for relocations based on the actual name of the section, without relying on the prefix. This modification effectively mitigates the risk of buffer over-reads by ensuring the software accurately identifies and processes only the intended sections, regardless of their naming.

Furthermore, the patch extends the modification to various components of the BFD library, including updates to function declarations and the way relocation sections are retrieved. By doing so, it ensures a robust and error-free handling of relocation information in binary files, preventing crashes and improving the stability and reliability of tools that utilize the BFD library for binary analysis and manipulation.
