The root cause of CVE-2017-8393 is an incorrect assumption in the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library, specifically libbfd, which is part of GNU Binutils. The vulnerability arises because the code logic within objcopy and strip utilities presumes that all section names for SHT_REL/SHR_RELA type sections begin with a .rel/.rela prefix. This assumption can lead to a global buffer over-read error. The flaw stems from the reliance on naming conventions to identify the purpose or type of a section within a binary file. When the expected naming convention is not followed, the logic to correctly map or process the section's relocation entries fails. This can cause buffer handling mechanisms to operate on wrong buffers or buffer sizes, leading to out-of-bound read operations. These operations can, in turn, result in crashes of the applications (like objcopy and strip) that use the libbfd library for analysis or manipulation of binary files. 

The patch rectifies this vulnerability by altering the mechanism used to find the section to which a set of relocations apply, instead of relying solely on the name's prefix. It introduces a more flexible approach that does not blindly assume the presence of .rel/.rela prefixes. The patch modifies and adds functions within the BFD library to correctly identify and handle relocation sections without making assumptions about their names. This change includes updates to function interfaces and the implementation of new logic for handling relocation section names, making the process robust against variations in naming conventions and thus preventing the previously possible buffer over-read scenarios.
