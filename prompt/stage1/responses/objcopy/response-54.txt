The root cause of CVE-2017-8393 in the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library, as distributed in GNU Binutils 2.28, is due to a flawed assumption within the library's handling of section names for relocation information. The code in question assumed that sections containing relocation information (SHT_REL/SHR_RELA sections) always have names starting with a .rel or .rela prefix. This assumption led to a global buffer over-read error.

In detail, the vulnerability stems from the library's process for handling object files and executables, particularly through utilities such as `objcopy` and `strip`, which perform operations like copying and modifying binary files or removing symbols and sections from files, respectively. The flawed assumption about section names means that if an input file did not adhere to this naming convention, it could cause these programs to attempt to read beyond the buffer allocated for the section names. This behavior could lead to crashes of the tools using the libbfd library due to accessing memory outside the bounds of the intended buffer, presenting a reliability issue and potentially could be leveraged for more malicious exploits if combined with other vulnerabilities.

The patch for this issue, committed by Alan Modra, addresses the problem by changing the handling and expectations around SHT_REL/RELA section names. It modifies the interface for `elf_backend_get_reloc_section`, removing the assumption that relocation section names begin with .rel/.rela. Instead of directly assuming the prefix to find the section to which relocations apply, the patched code more robustly determines the applicable section, including handling special cases like `.got.plt` or `.got` sections linked to relocation entries named with `.plt`. Additionally, specific backend functions just need to handle name mapping, allowing for more flexibility and accuracy in dealing with various section types and names.

This solution not only fixes the immediate issue of the buffer over-read error by addressing its root cause (the incorrect assumption about section name prefixes) but also enhances the library's overall reliability and correctness in processing binary files with diverse layouts and naming conventions.
