The root cause of CVE-2017-8393 in the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library (libbfd) is based on an inaccurate assumption present in the code that operates for the `objcopy` and `strip` utilities. Specifically, the issue arises from the assumption that sections of type SHT_REL/SHR_RELA, which are related to relocation data, are always named with prefixes `.rel` or `.rela`. When the code encounters a section that doesnâ€™t fit this naming convention, it results in a global buffer over-read. This buffer over-read can cause programs utilizing the libbfd library for binary analysis, such as `objcopy` and `strip`, to crash.

The BFD library is used as a backend by several GNU Binutils tools (like `objcopy` and `strip`) to read and manipulate binary object files across different formats. Its function, as indicated by this CVE, is critical in handling binary data correctly, particularly concerning relocations which are essential for resolving symbol addresses at either compile-time or runtime.

To address this vulnerability, the patch involves changes in how the libbfd codebase manages relocation sections. Instead of the previous approach that assumed a fixed naming convention, modifications include altering the function `elf_backend_get_reloc_section` along with others to dynamically determine the target section for relocations based on the actual section names rather than relying on the prefix. This involves deleting the original `_bfd_elf_get_reloc_section` function and replacing its functionality with `_bfd_elf_plt_get_reloc_section` and `elf_get_reloc_section`, ensuring that the correct section is identified without assuming specific naming patterns.

The modifications in the patch correct the vulnerability by removing the faulty assumption and replacing it with a more robust mechanism for locating the applicable sections for relocation entries irrespective of their naming conventions. This not only fixes the immediate issue causing the crashes but also enhances the BFD library's capability to work with a wider variety of binary formats and naming schemes, contributing to the overall stability and reliability of the tools that depend on it.
