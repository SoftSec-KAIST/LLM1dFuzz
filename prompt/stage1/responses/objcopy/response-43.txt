The root cause of CVE-2017-8393 is an incorrect assumption in the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library, which is part of GNU Binutils, specifically in the handling of SHT_REL/SHR_RELA sections. The vulnerability stems from the assumption that sections of these types are always named starting with a .rel/.rela prefix. This assumption is violated when a section does not follow this naming convention, leading to a global buffer over-read error. This problem arises because the software does not properly validate or handle the case where a section's name does not start with the expected prefix, causing it to read beyond the allocated buffer when trying to find the section to which a relocation applies.

The patch addresses this issue by changing how the library identifies the section to which a given SHT_REL/SHR_RELA section applies. Instead of making assumptions based on the section name's prefix, the patched code uses a more robust method to map the relocation section to its corresponding target section. This involves modifying the elf_backend_get_reloc_section interface and related functions to ensure that they no longer rely on the presence of a .rel/.rela prefix to determine the section to which relocations apply. By doing so, the patch eliminates the faulty assumption and thus resolves the vulnerability, making the library more resilient to unexpected or non-standard section names in binary files.
