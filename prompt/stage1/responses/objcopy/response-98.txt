The root cause of CVE-2017-8393 lies in the incorrect assumption within the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library used in GNU Binutils 2.28 that the names of sections containing relocation information (SHT_REL/SHR_RELA) always start with a .rel/.rela prefix. This assumption fails in cases where a section does not follow this naming convention, leading to a situation where the code attempts to access or interpret data beyond the intended bounds of the buffer. This can result in a buffer over-read error, which may make programs like `objcopy` and `strip`—that rely on the libbfd library for analyzing and manipulating binary programs—susceptible to crashing.

The vulnerability stems from a design oversight in the handling of section names that deviate from the expected naming pattern. When the libbfd library encounters a section that it assumes contains relocation information based on its name, it proceeds under the expectation that the name follows the conventional .rel/.rela prefix. If the actual section name does not adhere to this pattern, the library's logic for indexing into and interpreting the binary data becomes flawed, leading to an attempt to read beyond the allocated buffer for the section name. This constitutes a classic buffer over-read scenario, which is a form of undefined behavior that can result in crashes or, in more severe cases, could potentially be exploited for information disclosure if specific conditions outside the scope of this CVE are met.

The patch addresses this vulnerability by modifying the way the libbfd library determines which sections the relocation information applies to, removing the incorrect assumption about section name prefixes. It introduces a more robust mechanism for identifying the target sections of relocation entries, involving changes to function definitions and calls that process section names and relocation information. This approach minimizes the risk of buffer over-read by ensuring that section name handling is more accurately aligned with the actual structure and content of the binary files being processed, thus mitigating the crash issue described in CVE-2017-8393.
