The root cause of CVE-2017-8393 lies in the incorrect assumption within the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library, specifically in the way it handles section names for relocation sections (SHT_REL/SHR_RELA). The library, as utilized in tools like objcopy and strip, mistakenly presumed that these relocation sections would invariably begin with either a .rel or .rela prefix. This flawed assumption could lead to a buffer over-read error, potentially causing a crash when analyzing binary programs using the libbfd library.

The issue arises because there's an expectation set on the naming convention of the section names, which isn't an enforced standard across all binaries. When a binary doesn't follow this naming convention, the library's logic would fail, leading to incorrect memory access.

The patch addresses this root cause by updating the way section names for relocation are handled. Instead of assuming the prefix, it now properly identifies the sections to which relocations apply based on actual names rather than a forced prefix. It achieves this by modifying the interface of `elf_backend_get_reloc_section` and introducing new functions that no longer make presumptions about the prefix in the section names. This way, it caters to a broader range of binaries, preventing the buffer over-read issue and enhancing the stability and reliability of tools relying on the libbfd library.
