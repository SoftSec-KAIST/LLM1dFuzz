The root cause of CVE-2017-8393 in the GNU Binutils Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library, particularly affecting the `libbfd` component, was an incorrect assumption within the code handling `objcopy` and `strip` operations. Specifically, the vulnerability arose from the presumption that all sections of types `SHT_REL` and `SHT_RELA` (which denote relocation sections in ELF binaries) always have names starting with the prefixes `.rel` and `.rela` respectively.

This incorrect assumption led to a global buffer over-read error. In the context of binary manipulation and analysis tools like `objcopy` and `strip` that rely on `libbfd`, encountering relocation sections that did not adhere to the naming convention caused these utilities to crash. This is because the code attempted to access memory beyond the allocated bounds when it blindly expected certain prefixes in section names.

The patch addresses this vulnerability by altering the approach to no longer make hard assumptions about the section names starting with `.rel` and `.rela`. Instead, it involves updating the `elf_backend_get_reloc_section` interface to handle name mapping more flexibly, removing the previous assumption. This ensures that section name processing accounts for variations more robustly, preventing the buffer over-read condition regardless of the section naming.

The code changes include modifications to various files where section names are processed, ensuring that a more generalized and safer method is applied for identifying the target section a relocation section applies to. This approach mitigates the risk of crashes caused by unexpected section naming conventions, thus addressing the vulnerability described by CVE-2017-8393.
