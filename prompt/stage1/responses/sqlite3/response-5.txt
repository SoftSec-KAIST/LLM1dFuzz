The root cause of CVE-2019-19923 in SQLite 3.30.1 before the patch was a mishandling of certain uses of `SELECT DISTINCT` combined with a `LEFT JOIN`, where the right-hand side of the `LEFT JOIN` was a view. This specific combination of query elements led to two potential issues:

1. **Null Pointer Dereference**: When the optimization involving query flattening for a `LEFT JOIN` was applied, it could lead to a situation where, due to the distinct nature of the outer query, stale result registers were accessed. This stale access was because the query flattening optimization incorrectly handled the semantics of `SELECT DISTINCT`, leading to a scenario where an `OP_IfNullRow` opcode might attempt to operate on an unopened table. An unopened table means that the data structure expected to be in memory was not present, leading to a situation where the code would dereference a null pointer, causing a crash.

2. **Incorrect Results**: Besides the risk of crashing, the improper application of the optimization could cause the database engine to yield incorrect results for queries. This is because the stale registers could contain outdated or irrelevant data, and accessing these stale registers could lead to logically incorrect query results being produced.

The patch resolves these issues by adding an additional check (`(3d) the outer query may not be DISTINCT`) to the conditions under which query flattening for a `LEFT JOIN` is not allowed. By preventing query flattening in the presence of `SELECT DISTINCT`, the patch ensures that the problematic optimization that led to null pointer dereferences and incorrect results is not applied, thus preventing the issues without significantly impacting the overall performance or functionality of the database engine.

In summary, the root cause of CVE-2019-19923 was an optimization logic flaw in the handling of `SELECT DISTINCT` with `LEFT JOIN` queries, specifically when the right-hand side of the `LEFT JOIN` was a view. The flaw could lead to null pointer dereferences and incorrect query results due to stale data access. The fix involved adding a condition to prevent the problematic optimization from being applied in such scenarios.
