The root cause of CVE-2019-19923 lies in the mishandling of certain SQL queries involving `SELECT DISTINCT` when combined with a `LEFT JOIN` where the right-hand side is a view, within SQLite's `flattenSubquery` function in `select.c`. The main issue was that the optimization logic did not account for the special case where the outer query uses `DISTINCT` and the right-hand side of the `LEFT JOIN` is a view. This oversight led to scenarios where an index scan on the table within the view could attempt to access stale result registers, leading to incorrect query results. Additionally, an `OP_IfNullRow` opcode could be invoked on an un-opened table within the view, causing a NULL-pointer dereference. 

The root cause of the problem was SQLite's query optimization strategy specifically, its handling of query flattening when certain conditions were met. Query flattening is a technique used to optimize SQL queries by merging subqueries into the outer query, thus potentially simplifying the query execution plan. However, this optimization needs to be carefully applied as certain query structures, such as those involving `DISTINCT` and `LEFT JOIN` with views, can have intricacies that, if not properly handled, lead to undefined behavior or errors.

The patch addresses this issue by further refining the conditions under which query flattening is allowed. It introduces a new rule that explicitly prevents query flattening if the outer query is `DISTINCT` (condition 3d). By disallowing query flattening for `DISTINCT` outer queries that involve a `LEFT JOIN` with a view on the right-hand side, the patch ensures that SQLite no longer mishandles these specific cases, thereby avoiding the incorrect results and NULL-pointer dereferences previously observed.

In summary, the root cause of CVE-2019-19923 can be attributed to the insufficient handling of query optimization when `SELECT DISTINCT` is used with a `LEFT JOIN` where the right-hand side is a view. The effective resolution involved updating the conditions under which query flattening is permitted, thereby ensuring the database engine correctly handles these complex query scenarios.
