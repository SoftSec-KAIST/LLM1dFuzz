The root cause of CVE-2019-19923 in SQLite arises from an optimization issue related to the handling of SELECT DISTINCT queries combined with a LEFT JOIN where the right-hand side is a view. The specific details of the cause can be understood by looking at the original implementation and the fix that addresses the vulnerability:

1. **Original Issue**: When SQLite performs a query that includes a SELECT DISTINCT combined with a LEFT JOIN where the right-hand side is a view, it attempts to optimize the query by flattening the subquery (the query executed on the view). The optimization aims to merge the subquery into the outer query to potentially execute the query more efficiently. However, in the scenario described, this optimization could lead to incorrect behaviour in two ways:

    - **Stale Result Registers**: SQLite might attempt to access result registers that are no longer valid or have not been properly initialized. Result registers are used to store intermediate results during query execution. Accessing stale registers could yield incorrect results.
    
    - **NULL Pointer Dereference**: If an `OP_IfNullRow` opcode is expected to be executed on a table that hasn't been opened (because of the assumption that the subquery has been flattened), it can lead to a NULL pointer dereference. This operation checks if the current row being processed is NULL, which is relevant in the context of OUTER JOINS where missing matches can yield NULLs. Attempting to perform this operation on a non-opened table can cause the system to attempt to dereference a NULL pointer, leading to a crash.

2. **The Fix**: The patch explicitly prevents the query flattening optimization when the outer query uses SELECT DISTINCT. By adding a condition that prevents flattening if the outer query is DISTINCT (`(p->selFlags & SF_Distinct)!=0`), SQLite ensures that it does not proceed with an optimization that could lead to incorrect results or system crashes. This change is pointed out in the patch with additional comments in the code to document this behavior.

Additionally, the patch handles other conditions where flattening should not occur, which include cases where the subquery is a LEFT JOIN (`JT_OUTER`), there are more than one source in the FROM clause of the subquery, the outer query is an aggregate, or the subquery involves a virtual table, ensuring a more robust handling of various scenarios that could lead to incorrect behavior.

In summary, the root cause of CVE-2019-19923 was an oversight in the query optimization logic of SQLite, particularly in handling SELECT DISTINCT in conjunction with LEFT JOIN on views, which could lead to incorrect query results or a crash due to NULL pointer dereference, addressed by adding a safeguard against query flattening in such scenarios.
