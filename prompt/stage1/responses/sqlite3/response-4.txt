The root cause of CVE-2019-19923 in SQLite 3.30.1, as indicated by the patch and description, stems from an optimization flaw related to the handling of `SELECT DISTINCT` combined with a `LEFT JOIN` where the right-hand side of the `LEFT JOIN` is a view. 

SQLite attempted to optimize query execution by flattening subqueries. However, when the outer query used `SELECT DISTINCT`, and the inner query (particularly within a view on the right-hand side of a `LEFT JOIN`) was subject to this optimization, two major issues could arise:

1. **Incorrect Results**: The optimization could lead to "stale result registers" being accessed. Stale result registers occur when the optimization mistakenly reuses results from a previous state of the database or a previous execution of a part of the query. This reusage can provide incorrect results because the data in these registers may not represent the current state or correct context of the query's execution.

2. **NULL Pointer Dereference**: If an index scan runs on the table within the view on the right-hand side of the `LEFT JOIN`, and if an `OP_IfNullRow` opcode is invoked on an un-opened table due to the query optimization, it could result in attempting to access a NULL pointer. This is because the optimization incorrectly assumes the availability or state of certain data structures within the database engine, leading to unsafe memory access attempts.

The patch specifically addresses these problems by updating the conditions under which subquery flattening is allowed. It adds a new restriction (marked as **(3d)** in the code comments) that prevents flattening if the outer query is `DISTINCT`. This change ensures that when there's a `SELECT DISTINCT` involved, particularly with a structure that includes a `LEFT JOIN` whose right-hand side is a view, SQLite no longer applies the query flattening optimization that was leading to incorrect results and potential null pointer dereferences.

By making this adjustment, SQLite ensures the integrity of query results under these conditions and eliminates the path that led to unsafe memory access, directly addressing the root cause of CVE-2019-19923.
