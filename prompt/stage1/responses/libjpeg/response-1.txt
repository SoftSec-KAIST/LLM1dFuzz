The root cause of CVE-2018-14498 in `libjpeg-turbo` and `MozJPEG` appears to be the lack of proper validation for indexed colors (color indices) used in 8-bit BMP files before using them to access elements in the color palette (colormap). Specifically, the vulnerability arises from an out-of-bounds read condition where one or more of the color indices in a crafted 8-bit BMP file exceed the number of entries available in the color palette. This can lead to accessing memory outside the bounds of the heap-allocated colormap array, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS) due to application crash or potentially leaking memory content.

To address this vulnerability, a patch was applied to ensure that the indexed color values (referenced as `t` in the patched code) are within the bounds of the colormap's length (`cmaplen`). This validation was added in multiple places within the `get_8bit_row` function in `rdbmp.c`, which handles the processing of 8-bit BMP files. If an out-of-range index is detected, the patch makes the program exit with an error (`JERR_BMP_OUTOFRANGE`), effectively preventing an attacker from exploiting this vulnerability to crash the application or perform other malicious actions.

In summary, the root cause is improper bounds checking when processing indexed colors in 8-bit BMP files, which the patch addresses by adding appropriate validations.
