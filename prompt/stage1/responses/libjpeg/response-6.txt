The root cause of CVE-2018-14498 in libjpeg-turbo and MozJPEG is related to the handling of crafted 8-bit BMP files. Specifically, the vulnerability stems from a heap-based buffer over-read condition in the `get_8bit_row` function within the `rdbmp.c` file. This condition occurs when one or more of the color indices in a crafted 8-bit BMP file are out of range for the number of palette entries. Such an out-of-range index leads to an attempt to read beyond the bounds of the allocated heap memory for the colormap, causing a denial of service (application crash) due to the heap-based buffer over-read.

The patch provided aims to address this issue by performing bounds checking on the color indices used to access the colormap. In the modified code, before using a color index to access the colormap, the code checks if the index is greater than or equal to the length of the colormap (`cmap_length`). If the index is out of range, the program triggers an error and exits the current function via the `ERREXIT` macro, which prevents the invalid access that could lead to the buffer over-read.

By introducing this bounds checking mechanism, the patch effectively prevents attackers from causing a denial of service by exploiting the vulnerability with specially crafted BMP files.

Additionally, it's worth noting that this specific root cause—improper validation of user input leading to out-of-bounds reads—is a common type of vulnerability in software that processes complex file formats. In this case, ensuring that all indices used to access sensitive resources like memory buffers are within valid ranges is a critical part of mitigating such vulnerabilities.
