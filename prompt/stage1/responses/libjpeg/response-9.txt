The root cause of CVE-2018-14498 in libjpeg-turbo and MozJPEG is due to an out-of-bounds (OOB) read vulnerability when handling malformed 8-bit BMP files. In these files, one or more color indices can be out of range for the number of available palette entries, leading to a heap-based buffer over-read. This occurs because the software does not adequately validate that the color index values read from the BMP file fall within the expected range defined by the color palette size of the BMP file.

When the software attempts to read and use these out-of-range color indices to access elements from the color palette array, it ends up reading data beyond the allocated heap buffer. This can lead to a denial of service (DoS) via application crash due to attempting to access invalid memory addresses. 

The issue was addressed by adding bounds checking for color indices used during BMP file processing, ensuring that indices do not exceed the size of the color palette. Specifically, the patch introduces explicit checks (`if (t >= cmaplen) ERREXIT(cinfo, JERR_BMP_OUTOFRANGE);`) within the `get_8bit_row` function in `rdbmp.c` to ensure color indices are within the valid range before accessing the color palette array. If an out-of-range color index is encountered, an error is triggered, preventing the out-of-bounds access and avoiding the application crash.

Additionally, the patch includes changes to error message handling and replaces a previous error enum value (`JERR_PPM_TOOLARGE`) with a more appropriate one (`JERR_PPM_OUTOFRANGE`) to better reflect the nature of the error. These modifications together form a comprehensive fix that mitigates the vulnerability by both preventing invalid memory access and enhancing error handling.
