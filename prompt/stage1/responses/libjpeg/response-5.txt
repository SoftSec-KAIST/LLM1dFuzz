The root cause of CVE-2018-14498 in libjpeg-turbo and MozJPEG is an out-of-bounds read vulnerability in the handling of 8-bit BMP files. Specifically, the vulnerability is triggered when the software attempts to process an 8-bit BMP image file where one or more color indices used in the file exceed the bounds of the color palette defined within that BMP file. Each pixel in an 8-bit BMP file is represented by an index into a color palette, but if the index goes beyond the allocated size of the palette (i.e., references a color index that doesn't exist), it leads to a heap-based buffer over-read. This over-read can cause a Denial of Service (DoS) through an application crash as it attempts to access memory outside the bounds of the allocated heap memory for the palette.

The patch resolves this vulnerability by adding bounds checking to ensure color indices are within the range of the defined color palette before attempting to access the palette array. Specifically, it involves updating the `get_8bit_row` function and similar functions to verify that each color index 't' is lower than `cmaplen`, the length of the color map, before using 't' to index into the color map array. If an out-of-range index 't' is detected (`if (t >= cmaplen)`), the patch ensures that the application will exit with an error message (`ERREXIT(cinfo, JERR_BMP_OUTOFRANGE)`) instead of continuing execution and causing undefined behavior or crashes. This fundamentally addresses the root cause by preventing out-of-bound accesses based on malformed or malicious input files, safeguarding against Denial of Service and potential further exploits from memory corruption vulnerabilities.
