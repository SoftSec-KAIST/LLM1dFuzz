The root cause of CVE-2018-14498 in libjpeg-turbo and MozJPEG is related to the handling of color indices in 8-bit BMP images. When decoding a specially crafted BMP file, the `get_8bit_row` function in `rdbmp.c` can encounter color indices that exceed the bounds of the BMP file's color table. This leads to an out-of-bounds (OOB) read, as the program attempts to access data beyond the allocated heap memory for the color table. This can cause a denial of service (DoS) due to a heap-based buffer over-read, resulting in an application crash. 

The patch addresses this vulnerability by checking if the color index `t` is within the bounds of the allocated color table (`cmap_length`) before attempting to access the color table. If `t` is outside the bounds of the color table, the function now triggers an error condition using `ERREXIT(cinfo, JERR_BMP_OUTOFRANGE)` to prevent reading beyond the allocated memory. This fundamentally mitigates the risk associated with attempting to access or interpret data outside the intended memory bounds, preventing the described denial of service condition. Additionally, the patch includes changes to error handling and messages to reflect the nature of the out-of-bounds condition more accurately.
