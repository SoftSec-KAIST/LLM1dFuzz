The root cause of CVE-2018-14498 is related to an out-of-bounds read vulnerability in the `get_8bit_row` function within `rdbmp.c` in libjpeg-turbo and MozJPEG. This function is responsible for handling 8-bit BMP files. Specifically, the vulnerability occurs when processing a specially crafted BMP file where one or more of the color indices specified in the BMP file exceed the bounds of the file's color table. This flaw leads to an out-of-bounds read, which could result in a heap-based buffer over-read and ultimately cause a denial of service (application crash) when attempting to access memory outside the bounds of the allocated heap.

To address this vulnerability, the patch introduces a check within the `get_8bit_row` function to verify that the color index being processed does not exceed the number of entries in the color table (`cmap_length`). If an out-of-range index is encountered, the library reports an error and exits the processing routine, effectively preventing the invalid memory access that would lead to an application crash. The patch ensures that all places where color indices are accessed within the function include this bounds-checking logic to safeguard against out-of-bounds read attempts.

In summary, the core issue was the lack of validation for color indices against the size of the color table, which could be exploited through a malformed BMP file to trigger a denial of service. The implemented fix addresses this by enforcing proper bounds checking for color indices.
