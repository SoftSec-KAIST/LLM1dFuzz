The root cause of CVE-2018-14498 lies in the insufficient validation of color indices in the handling of 8-bit BMP files, resulting in an out-of-bounds (OOB) read. When processing an 8-bit BMP file, the library expects each byte in the BMP data (representing a color index) to correspond to a valid entry in the BMP's color palette. However, if the BMP file is crafted such that it contains color indices which exceed the bounds of the allocated color palette, the software would attempt to read data from beyond the allocated memory for the color palette. This scenario can lead to a heap-based buffer over-read, resulting in a crash and thus a denial of service (DoS).

The patch addresses this vulnerability by introducing checks to verify that the color indices are within the bounds of the color palette. These checks are implemented by comparing each color index against the `cmap_length`, which represents the number of entries in the color palette, and throwing an error if any index exceeds this bound. By ensuring that all color indices are valid and within the range of the color palette, the patch effectively mitigates the risk of out-of-bounds reads and prevents potential crashes, thus resolving the vulnerability described in CVE-2018-14498.
