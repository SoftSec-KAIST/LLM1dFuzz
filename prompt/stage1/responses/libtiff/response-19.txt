The root cause of the CVE-2016-10269 vulnerability in LibTIFF versions prior to the patch is a heap-based buffer overflow. This vulnerability is triggered when generating PixarLog or LUV compressed TIFF files with certain configurations (ColorMap, TransferFunction attached, and specific manipulation with bitspersample). Such a condition allows for a crafted TIFF image to cause a denial of service (heap-based buffer over-read) or potentially lead to unspecified impacts when processed by the libTIFF library. 

The problem seems to be tied fundamentally to the way memory is allocated and accessed/manipulated within these specific compression schemes (PixarLog and LUV) in the libTIFF’s implementation. Incorrect initialization and handling of the encoder state, along with assumptions made about the sample format and bits per sample in TIFF files when they are being closed, contribute to this vulnerability. The patch addresses these issues by correcting the heap-based buffer overflow problem – adding necessary checks and initializations (like setting the `encoder_state`) to ensure that the processing of TIFF images, specifically with the mentioned configurations, does not read out of the allocated heap memory bounds. 

This fix introduces a more cautious approach to managing the state and proper setup for encoding, coupled with validations during the resource release or file close operations to prevent sneaky manipulations that previously could lead to exploitable conditions. Thus, the root cause is essentially tied to a lack of proper validation and handling of memory operations concerning certain TIFF image configurations, leading to dangerous over-read situations.
