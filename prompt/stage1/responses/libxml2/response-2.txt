The root cause of CVE-2017-9047 in libxml2 involves improper buffer size checks in the function `xmlSnprintfElementContent` within `valid.c`, which is responsible for dumping the element content definition into a character buffer.

When computing the length to check if there is enough space left in the buffer for appending text, the function initially uses the `len` variable, which is assigned the length of the `buf` content at the start of the function execution. However, this approach does not account for the changes in buffer size as data is appended. Specifically, before appending the content->prefix and content->name, the function does not recompute `len` to reflect the current length of `buf`. This oversight leads to incorrect assumptions about the available space in `buf`. As a result, when the contentâ€™s prefix and name are appended without proper space checks based on the updated buffer size, it can cause a buffer overflow. This overflow allows writing beyond the allocated memory size, potentially leading to crashes in applications using libxml2, like PHP.

The patch address this issue by introducing a more accurate method for checking the buffer size before appending more strings to it. Before appending the `prefix` and `name`, the patch calculates the total length required, including these additions and a potential colon separator between prefix and name. It then checks if the addition of the required length would exceed the buffer size minus a safety margin (in this case, 10 bytes plus the required length for further content, such as " ..."). If there isn't enough space, it terminates the appending process with " ...", indicating omitted content. This prevents the buffer overflow and ensures that memory beyond the allocated size for `buf` is not improperly accessed.
