The root cause of CVE-2017-9047 is improper buffer size checks in the function xmlSnprintfElementContent within the libxml2 library. Specifically, the function attempts to append strings (`content->prefix` and `content->name`) to a buffer without accurately checking if there is sufficient remaining space in the buffer to accommodate these strings. Here's a breakdown of how the vulnerability occurs:

1. **Initial Length Calculation Errors**: The function determines the current length of the buffer (`len`) with `strlen(buf)` but fails to update this length after appending data to the buffer. This outdated length value is erroneously used for subsequent space checks.

2. **Incorrect Buffer Length Check**: Before appending `content->prefix` and `content->name`, the function should check if the buffer has enough space to contain the new data. However, the original code only checks if the remaining buffer space is less than a hard-coded value (10) after each append, which is an inaccurate method to prevent buffer overflow. The hard-coded check doesnâ€™t consider the actual lengths of `content->prefix` and `content->name`.

3. **Concatenation Without Size Checking**: The function uses `strcat` to append strings to the buffer, which does not perform any buffer boundary checks. Thus, if the length calculations were inaccurate or the checks insufficient, it would lead to writing beyond the allocated buffer size, causing a buffer overflow.

The patch addressed these issues by adding accurate checks for the available buffer space before appending strings. It calculates the total length needed for the new data (`qnameLen`) including if there's a prefix present (and accounts for the ':' character). Then, it checks if this new data, along with a margin (`10` characters, likely for additional formatting or terminators), will fit into the remaining buffer space (`size - len`). If not, it truncates the output with " ...". This effectively prevents the buffer overflow by ensuring data is only appended when there is confirmed space in the buffer. Additionally, the patch includes a check after the switch case to prevent buffer overflow when appending the final parts of the element content, further securing the function against similar overflow vulnerabilities.
