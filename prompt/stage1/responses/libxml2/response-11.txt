The root cause of CVE-2017-9047 is a buffer overflow vulnerability in the libxml2 library, specifically within the `xmlSnprintfElementContent` function in the `valid.c` file. The issue arises from improper buffer size checks when appending strings to a buffer, leading to potential writing beyond the allocated memory space. Here's a closer look at the problem:

1. **Incorrect Buffer Length Calculation:** The vulnerability is primarily due to the incorrect calculation of the remaining buffer space during the appending of strings. The original code assigns the variable `len` to the length of the buffer using `strlen(buf)`. However, subsequent checks intended to prevent buffer overflow when appending the `content->prefix` and `content->name` incorrectly rely on the initial value of `len` for calculating the remaining space. These checks do not account for the fact that `buf` has been modified (possibly expanded) in the meantime, leading to an outdated space calculation.

2. **Failure to Update Buffer Size Accurately:** After appending `content->prefix`, the code does not re-calculate the actual remaining buffer space before attempting to append `content->name`. This oversight allows for the scenario where the content's name could exceed the buffer's remaining space, thereby causing a buffer overflow.

3. **Lack of Comprehensive Buffer Overflow Prevention:** The original implementation lacks a comprehensive mechanism to ensure that the buffer isn't overflowed when appending different types of content. This is evident from the reliance on a fixed value check (`size - len < xmlStrlen(content->name) + 10`) which is insufficient for accurately gauging and preventing buffer overflow in various scenarios the function might encounter.

The patch addresses these issues by introducing more accurate checks before appending strings to the buffer. It calculates the total length required (taking into account the length of the `content->prefix`, if present, plus the length of `content->name`, and a possible `":"` separator) and compares it against the remaining space in the buffer (`size - len`). If the space is insufficient to accommodate the new string plus an additional margin (the code checks if less than `qnameLen + 10` space is left), it appends " ..." to indicate truncation and stops further processing, thus preventing buffer overflow.

In sum, the root cause is inadequate validation of buffer space before appending strings within the `xmlSnprintfElementContent` function, which could allow attackers to exploit this oversight to cause a buffer overflow, potentially leading to crashes or other undesirable behaviors in applications utilizing the libxml2 library.
