The root cause of CVE-2017-9047 is a failure to properly check for buffer space availability in the `xmlSnprintfElementContent` function within the `libxml2` library. Specifically, this vulnerability stems from the handling of string concatenations into a buffer without sufficiently validating that the buffer has enough space to accommodate the new content, thereby resulting in a buffer overflow situation.

The flawed logic resides in the calculation and checking of the available buffer space. Initially, the variable `len` is set to the length of the current buffer content using `strlen(buf)`. The critical issue arises when appending additional strings (`content->prefix` and `content->name`) to this buffer. The checks meant to ensure these additional strings fit within the remaining buffer space incorrectly reuse the initial `len` value instead of recalculating the buffer's current length after each concatenation. Consequently, this oversight permits attempts to write more data to the buffer than its allocated size can hold, leading to memory corruption.

The patch addresses this issue by introducing a proper calculation of the length of the strings that are meant to be added (`content->prefix` and `content->name`) and then checking if these can fit into the remaining buffer space before attempting the concatenation. Specifically, it calculates the required buffer space accounting for the lengths of `content->prefix`, `content->name`, and an additional character for the colon when `content->prefix` is present. It then compares this required space against the remaining buffer space (`size - len`). If the space is insufficient, it truncates the output with " ..." and returns early to prevent buffer overflow.

In summary, the root cause of CVE-2017-9047 is an insufficient buffer space check before appending strings to a buffer, which could lead to buffer overflow. The patch resolves this issue by correctly calculating and validating the needed space before performing any buffer manipulations.
