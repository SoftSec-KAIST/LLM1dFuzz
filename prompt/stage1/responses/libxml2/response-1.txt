The root cause of CVE-2017-9047 lies in the improper management of buffer size checks within the `xmlSnprintfElementContent` function in `valid.c` of the libxml2 library. Specifically, the vulnerability arises from the application's failure to accurately calculate and validate the remaining buffer space when appending content such as element names and prefixes to a buffer. The original code did not account for the updated buffer length after each concatenation operation, relying instead on the length of the buffer (`len`) as it was before any modifications.

When the function attempts to append the `content->prefix` and `content->name` to the buffer `buf`, it checks if there is enough space using the initial length of `buf`, instead of recalculating the available space after each append operation. This oversight allows for a scenario where more data can be written to the buffer than it can actually hold, leading to a buffer overflow. Buffer overflows can corrupt memory, cause a program to crash, and potentially enable an attacker to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (DoS).

The patch corrects this vulnerability by introducing additional checks to ensure that the space being checked for availability in the buffer (`size - len`) is accurately reflective of the space remaining after each operation. It calculates the length required for the new content (taking into account the length of `content->prefix`, the length of `content->name`, and an extra character for the colon when a prefix exists) before attempting to append it to the buffer. If there isn't enough space, the function now correctly truncates the output with `" ..."` and returns early to prevent overflow, thus addressing the vulnerability effectively.

This fix ensures that the buffer is managed securely, preventing potential overflows by accurately tracking the buffer space available at each step of appending content, which is critical for maintaining the integrity and security of applications that utilize the libxml2 library.
