The root cause of CVE-2016-4487 appears to stem from a use-after-free vulnerability within the libiberty code, specifically related to handling binary inputs. The key evidences pointing to this are found both in the CVE description and the patch that was applied to mitigate the vulnerability.

The use-after-free vulnerability occurs when memory is incorrectly managed, becoming susceptible to unexpected modifications or access after it has been freed. In the context of this CVE, the vulnerability allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service through a crafted binary. This is indicative of a programming error where the software uses a pointer to memory that has already been freed, leading to a segmentation fault and program crash. Such vulnerabilities are highly critical as they can potentially be exploited to execute arbitrary code.

Key insights from the patch:
1. **Zeroing bsize/ksize after Freeing**: One of the notable changes made to address this vulnerability was in `cplus-dem.c` where, after freeing `btypevec` and `ktypevec`, their respective sizes (`bsize`/`ksize`) are explicitly set to zero. This is a common practice to mitigate use-after-free vulnerabilities by ensuring that dangling pointers don't point to freed memory, reducing the likelihood of unintended actions if the memory is accessed after being freed.

2. **Sanity Checks and Avoiding Overflow**: Another part of the patch involves modifications to parse numeric values safely by changing the data type from `long` to `int` and introducing checks to prevent overflow. This is crucial as overflows can lead to undefined behavior, making the program vulnerable to exploits. The inclusion of `<limits.h>` and introduction of `INT_MAX` checks are indicative of efforts to ensure that operations stay within the bounds of what's safely manageable by the program, reducing the risk of memory corruption.

3. **Abort on Allocation Size Overflow**: The patch includes provisions to abort operations if there's detection of cases where the size of the allocation would overflow. This is critical in preventing scenarios where an attacker might cause the program to allocate insufficient memory and then exploit this behavior.

4. **Regression Test Cases**: Further emphasis on addressing the root cause is visible through the inclusion of regression test cases, suggesting a thorough approach to validating that the vulnerability has been mitigated and similar issues won't arise.

In summary, the root cause of CVE-2016-4487 is linked to the management of allocated memory when processing binaries, specifically through a use-after-free vulnerability that arises from incorrect memory handling techniques. The patch addresses this by ensuring proper memory deallocation practices, adding checks to prevent overflow and allocation size issues, and validating the solutions through comprehensive testing.
