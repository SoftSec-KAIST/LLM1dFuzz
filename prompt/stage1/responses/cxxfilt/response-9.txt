The root cause of CVE-2016-4487, a use-after-free vulnerability in libiberty, appears to be related to the handling of binary types and template parameters within the demangling functionality for C++ symbols, as used in error messages and debugging output.

Specifically, the issues leading to the vulnerability can be summarized as follows:

1. **Incorrect handling of numbers and potential overflows**: The code mishandles the parsing of numbers and does not adequately protect against overflow conditions. This is evident from the changes made to parse numbers as integers instead of longs, and the introduction of checks to avoid overflow by including limits.h and defining `INT_MAX` if necessary.

2. **Improper management of dynamic memory for type vectors (`btypevec`/`ktypevec`)**: The vulnerability stems from not zeroing out the lengths (`bsize`/`ksize`) of the type vectors after freeing them (`btypevec`/`ktypevec`) in `squangle_mop_up`, leading to a use-after-free condition because the code might attempt to access these already freed memory regions believing they still contain valid data.

3. **Allocation size overflow checks**: The patch introduces checks to abort operation if there are detections of cases where the size of an allocation would overflow. This is critical in preventing large or specially crafted inputs from causing unexpected behavior, possibly leading to execution of malicious code or crashing the application.

4. **Safe handling of special cases and signaling errors**: In one instance, the function `gnu_special` is modified to handle cases where `consume_count` returns -1, which wasn't properly addressed before. This type of adjustment ensures that the code more robustly handles error conditions and edge cases.

5. **Overall robustness improvements**: The changes include more defensive programming practices like ensuring integer variables are used in contexts where their limits are properly accounted for, and checking the results of operations more carefully (e.g., after attempting to parse a number).

In conclusion, the root cause of CVE-2016-4487 revolves around insufficient validation and error handling when dealing with user-supplied binary data in the context of demangling symbols, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. The patch addresses these issues by improving input validation, ensuring memory is managed safely, and introducing checks to prevent overflow and use-after-free conditions.
