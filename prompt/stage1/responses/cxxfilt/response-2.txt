The root cause of CVE-2016-4487 appears to be a combination of handling issues in the libiberty library, specifically around memory management and integer handling in the name demangling functionalities for C++ symbols. The issues include use-after-free vulnerabilities and potential integer overflow (or inappropriate integer size handling), leading to segmentation faults and crashes. Here are some key points contributing to the vulnerability based on the patch details:

1. **Use-After-Free in `btypevec` and `ktypevec`:** The patch mentions zeroing `bsize/ksize` after freeing `btypevec/ktypevec` in `cplus-dem.c`. This suggests that there was a use-after-free issue where the program would attempt to use these vectors after they had been freed, leading to undefined behavior and potential crashes.

2. **Integer Handling Problems:** The patch shows several fixes related to handling integers, such as changing the type of variables used to store numbers from `long` to `int`, adding checks for integer overflow, and ensuring proper definitions of `INT_MAX` are available. Parsing numbers as `int` instead of `long` to avoid overflow and including sanity checks helps prevent issues where very large numbers could cause the program to behave unexpectedly, potentially contributing to crashes.

3. **Improper Memory Allocation Size Calculations:** There are changes that abort the program if detection occurs where the size of the allocation would overflow. This suggests there were scenarios where calculations for memory allocation sizes could result in values that exceed the possible size of an `int`, causing overflows and potentially leading to memory corruption.

4. **Error Handling in `gnu_special`:** The patch also handles a case where `consume_count` returns `-1`, indicating a recognition of potential erroneous states that were not handled correctly before, which could lead to inappropriate memory accesses.

Overall, the root causes seem to revolve around incorrect memory management practices, including use-after-free incidents and insufficient guarding against integer overflows during memory allocation size calculations and number parsing. These issues combined could enable attackers to craft specific binaries that, when processed by libiberty's demangling functionalities, could lead to denial of service via segmentation faults and crashes.
