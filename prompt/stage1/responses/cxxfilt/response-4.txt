The root cause of CVE-2016-4487 appears to be tied to the handling of certain data structures within the libiberty component, particularly related to demangling functionalities. The essence of the issue stems from:

1. **Use-After-Free Vulnerability**: This class of vulnerabilities occurs when memory that has been previously freed is accessed again. This can lead to unexpected behavior such as segmentation faults, potentially crashing the application, or even execution of arbitrary code.

The specific details provided in the patch log suggest that the vulnerability is closely tied to how numbers and certain dynamic data structures (`btypevec` and `ktypevec`) are handled. Key areas addressed in the patch include:

- **Integer Handling and Bounds Checking**: The patch includes a shift from parsing numbers as `long` to parsing them as `integer` to prevent overflow after sanity checks. This adjustment, along with explicit bounds checking (e.g., ensuring that the index is not `INT_MAX` or `-1` before proceeding), helps mitigate scenarios where excessively large or inappropriate values could trigger buffer overflows or memory corruption.

- **Zeroing Data Structures After Freeing**: An important addition to the patch involves zeroing the size of `bsize`/`ksize` after the associated `btypevec`/`ktypevec` vectors are freed. This action helps prevent use-after-free vulnerabilities by ensuring that, even if a freed structure is accessed, its size will indicate it's empty, reducing the risk of accessing invalid memory addresses.

- **Prevent Allocation Overflows**: The patch includes preventive measures against allocation size overflows. By checking for potential overflows (e.g., ensuring the new allocation size does not exceed `INT_MAX`), the patch guards against scenarios where overly large allocations could lead to memory corruption or other unintended behaviors.

- **Safe Error Handling**: Adjustments in error handling ensure that in cases where abnormal or unexpected input leads to error states (such as `consume_count` returning `-1`), the application can safely handle these conditions without crashing or behaving unpredictably.

In summary, the root cause of CVE-2016-4487 revolves around insufficient handling of dynamic data structure sizes, improper integer parsing that could lead to overflows, and unsafe memory management practices such as using memory after it has been freed. The corrective measures introduced in the patch address these issues by introducing more robust bounds and error checking, using safer data types, and ensuring that memory is correctly managed throughout its lifecycle.
