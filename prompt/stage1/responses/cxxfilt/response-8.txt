The root cause of the CVE-2016-4487 vulnerability appears to be related to incorrect memory management and integer handling within the libiberty's implementation, particularly in functions dealing with demangling C++ symbols. Several key issues can be deduced from the patch provided:

1. **Use-After-Free Vulnerability**:
   - The specific use-after-free issue is addressed by zeroing out `bsize/ksize` after freeing `btypevec/ktypevec` in `squangle_mop_up` function. This ensures that the memory is not erroneously accessed after it has been freed, which is a typical cause of use-after-free bugs.

2. **Integer Handling and Overflow**:
   - The patch modifies several places where numbers are parsed or managed. It changes the parsing of numbers from longs to integers, including in function signatures. This could indicate that improper handling of number sizes or potential overflow issues were contributing factors to the vulnerability.
   - The inclusion of `<limits.h>` and checks against `INT_MAX` suggest there were concerns with integer overflow or underflow, which could lead to memory corruption, crashes, or other undefined behavior.

3. **Memory Allocation and Bounds Checking**:
   - The patch adds checks to prevent potential overflow in memory allocation functions (`remember_type`, `remember_Ktype`, `register_Btype`, and `string_need`). Prior to these checks, the code might have allowed calculations that exceed the maximum size of an integer during memory resizing operations, potentially leading to insufficient memory allocations and subsequent buffer overflows or other memory corruption issues.

4. **Demangling Issues and Robustness**:
   - A significant portion of the patch updates the `cp-demangle.c` file which is involved in demangling (converting the mangled names back to their original, human-readable form). The changes suggest that there may have been issues with how certain demangled names were parsed or handled, such as ensuring numbers are parsed correctly (as integers rather than longs) and managing special cases or erroneous states more robustly (e.g., checking for `-1` or `INT_MAX` return values).

In summary, the root cause of CVE-2016-4487 involves a combination of use-after-free vulnerabilities, improper integer and memory handling, and potential issues with the robustness of the name demangling process. The applied fixes aim to address these issues by improving memory management, adding bounds and overflow checks, ensuring integer types are handled correctly, and enhancing the overall robustness of the demangling process to prevent crashes or undefined behavior when handling crafted binary inputs.
