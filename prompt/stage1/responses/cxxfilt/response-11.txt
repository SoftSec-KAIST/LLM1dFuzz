The root cause of CVE-2016-4487 seems to be related to improper management of memory allocations and deallocations, specifically in the handling of dynamic data structures used for demangling symbols. The detailed explanation is as follows:

1. **Use-After-Free (UAF) Vulnerability:** The issue is a use-after-free vulnerability, which occurs when the program continues to use a pointer after it has been freed. This can lead to undefined behavior including crashes (segmentation faults) and potentially arbitrary code execution. The specific cause in this case is related to the handling of `btypevec` and `ktypevec` dynamic arrays used in the demangling process.

2. **Improper Memory Handling:** Based on the patches, we can see multiple fixes aimed at improving the robustness of memory handling:
   - Zeroing out sizes (`bsize`/`ksize`) after freeing (`btypevec`/`ktypevec`), to prevent their use after deallocation.
   - Handling cases where integer overflows might occur due to improper parsing of numbers (changing parsing from `long` to `int` and adding checks).
   - Preventing allocation sizes from exceeding `INT_MAX` to avoid overflows.

3. **Demangling Process Vulnerabilities:** Demangling is the process of converting mangled (encoded) names back to their original (source code) names. This is commonly required in debuggers and compilers dealing with C++ symbols. The vulnerability was triggered during this process, indicating that crafted binary input could exploit the way numbers were parsed and memory allocations were managed.

4. **Patch Analysis:** The patches include several preventative measures:
   - Sanitization of numeric values to avoid integer overflows.
   - Proper clean-up and initialisation of dynamic data structures to avoid use-after-free scenarios.
   - Additional checks for memory allocations to prevent overflows and ensure the safety of memory operations.

5. **Security Implication:** The main security implication of this vulnerability is that it could allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service via a crafted binary. In theory, depending on how the memory is managed post-deallocation, this could also potentially lead to arbitrary code execution, although this is not explicitly mentioned in the CVE description.

In summary, the root cause of CVE-2016-4487 is a combination of unsafe memory operations (use-after-free errors and integer overflows) during the demangling process. The patches focus on making the memory handling more robust and secure, thus mitigating the possible exploitation of the vulnerability.
