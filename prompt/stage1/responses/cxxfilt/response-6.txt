The root cause of CVE-2016-4487 appears to be a combination of issues related to how binary data is parsed and memory management within libiberty's demangler functions. Specifically, several key problems contributed to the use-after-free vulnerability:

1. **Integer Overflow**: There was insufficient handling for cases where parsing of numbers could lead to integer overflow. This is particularly evident in the parsing functions where numbers were initially parsed as `long` integers without adequate checks for overflow, which could lead to unintended behavior when these values were used in memory allocation or as array indices.

2. **Inadequate Memory Management**: The vulnerability was caused by a use-after-free issue, which suggests that memory was being accessed after it had been freed. This is specifically addressed in the patch by ensuring that after freeing `btypevec`/`ktypevec`, their sizes (`bsize`/`ksize`) are set to zero. Without proper zeroing, subsequent operations might incorrectly assume that these pointers are still valid, leading to the use of previously freed memory.

3. **Improper Parsing Logic**: The parsing functions had various issues, such as not correctly handling cases where parsing functions return error codes (e.g., returning -1). This could lead to improper memory operations based on erroneous data. For example, the `d_compact_number` function did not adequately check for errors, which could contribute to memory mismanagement issues.

4. **Potential for Buffer Overflow and Memory Allocation Overflows**: By not correctly checking for maximum sizes and potential overflows during memory allocations (`remember_type`, `remember_Ktype`, `register_Btype`, `string_need`), the application could either crash or behave unpredictably due to memory corruption.

The patch addresses these vulnerabilities by:

- Changing the parsing of numbers to use `int` instead of `long` and including checks against `INT_MAX` to prevent overflows.
- Including `<limits.h>` to ensure `INT_MAX` is defined.
- Ensuring that sizes are correctly managed by zeroing out `bsize`/`ksize` after freeing `btypevec`/`ktypevec` to prevent use-after-free issues.
- Adding checks to abort parsing or memory allocations if an overflow could occur, thereby better managing memory and preventing potential overflows or use-after-free vulnerabilities.

In summary, the vulnerability was primarily due to a combination of unsafe parsing of binary data, inadequate handling of integer overflows, and improper memory management practices. The patch mitigates these issues by implementing safer parsing strategies, proper overflow checks, and better memory cleanup processes.
