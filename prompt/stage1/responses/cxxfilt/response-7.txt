The root cause of CVE-2016-4487 is a use-after-free vulnerability in the libiberty library, particularly within its demangling functionalities used for parsing and interpreting binary files.

Use-after-free vulnerabilities occur when a program continues to use a pointer after it has freed the memory location it points to. This can lead to undefined behavior, including application crashes or, in some cases, code execution, depending on how the freed memory gets used or manipulated afterward. The specific issue here is related to the handling of binary files with crafted content that trick the library into misusing memory that has been freed.

From the provided patch, we can deduce several aspects that contributed to this vulnerability and its resolution:

1. **Integer Handling Improvements:** The patch changes function parameters from `long` to `int` types and introduces checks and functionality to properly handle overflow conditions. This indicates that part of the vulnerability could have involved improper size calculations or overflow issues that could result in erratic behavior, including memory corruption.

2. **Memory Zeroization:** The patch includes steps to zero out `bsize`/`ksize` after freeing `btypevec`/`ktypevec`. Zeroing out pointer or size values after freeing associated memory helps prevent use-after-free errors because it turns any use of the freed pointer into an attempt to access a NULL pointer or a zero-size object, both of which will be more predictably handled by the software (usually resulting in a quick crash or benign error), rather than leading to exploitation or unpredictable crashes.

3. **Bounds and Overflow Checks:** The changes include the introduction of bounds and overflow checks (`if (work -> typevec_size > INT_MAX / 2)`) in strategic locations, indicating an effort to prevent situations where arithmetic operations could lead to overflows that corrupt memory management logic, possibly enabling use-after-free scenarios.

4. **Special Case Handling:** Adjustments in handling special cases, such as when `consume_count` returns `-1`, suggest that the original code did not properly handle all possible return values or states, which could lead to inappropriate memory usage.

5. **General Robustness Improvements:** Including limits header and defining `INT_MAX` as necessary, and changing numbers parsing logic to avoid overflows demonstrates an overarching push towards making the code safer against malformed inputs that could lead to memory misuse.

In summary, the root cause of CVE-2016-4487 appears to be multifaceted, involving inadequate handling of integers, lack of proper memory usage and cleanup procedures, inadequate error and bounds checking, and possibly other issues related to how binary data is parsed and used. The patch addresses these issues by refining type usage, introducing more rigorous checks, and ensuring memory is appropriately handled after being freed to prevent its misuse.
