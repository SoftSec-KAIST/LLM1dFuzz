The root cause of CVE-2016-4487, as indicated by the description and the associated patch notes, revolves around a use-after-free vulnerability within the libiberty library, specifically when handling crafted binaries. This vulnerability stems from improper management of dynamic memory, specifically in how binary types (`btypevec`) and related vectors are accessed and manipulated.

Key points contributing to the vulnerability based on the patch content:

1. **Integer Parsing and Overflow Management**: Changes were made to parse numbers as integers rather than longs, which helps to prevent overflow after sanity checks. This indicates that part of the vulnerability might be related to how numbers are parsed and stored, leading to possible overflows or incorrect handling that could contribute to memory mismanagement. 

2. **Memory Allocation and Freeing Practices**: The patch addresses the process of zeroing out `bsize/ksize` after freeing `btypevec/ktypevec`, suggesting that the original issue might have been partly due to the lack of proper cleanup or resetting of values following the deallocation of memory. Failing to reset or clear these values can lead to situations where the program might try to access or use memory that has already been freed, leading to the use-after-free scenario.

3. **Improper Handling of Special Cases**: Adjustments were made to handle cases where `consume_count` returns -1 and to properly abort in cases where the size of an allocation would overflow. These changes imply that the vulnerability could also involve mishandling or not adequately checking specific edge cases, leading to scenarios where invalid or unexpected inputs could lead to destabilizing the memory state or invoking undefined behavior.

4. **Sanity Checks and Abort Conditions for Memory Operations**: The introduction of sanity checks and explicit abort conditions for cases that could lead to memory allocation overflow suggests that the original code might not have had sufficient checks in place to prevent overly large or incorrect memory operations that could lead to use-after-free conditions.

In summary, the root cause of CVE-2016-4487 appears to be multifaceted, involving a combination of insufficient input validation (leading to potential overflows), inadequate cleanup after memory deallocation, and the lack of robust checks and handling for edge cases. These issues collectively could allow an attacker to craft input (in the form of a binary) that manipulates memory operations in a way that triggers a segmentation fault and crash due to use-after-free vulnerability. The patch addresses these issues by implementing tighter type checking, improving memory management practices, adding necessary sanity checks, and handling special or edge cases more carefully.
