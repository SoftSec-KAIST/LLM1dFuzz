Based on the information about CVE-2020-24370 and the provided patch, it appears that the root cause of the vulnerability was a negation overflow issue within the `getlocal` and `setlocal` functions as implemented in `ldebug.c` of Lua 5.4.0. The negation overflow occurs when attempting to negate an integer value that is at the limit of its representable range, which—in the case of a signed integer—is often `-2^31` for 32-bit integers. This operation cannot be represented within the same type, leading to undefined behavior or, as demonstrated, a segmentation fault.

Specifically, the issue was related to handling negative indices for accessing variable arguments (varargs) within a Lua function, which Lua allows as a feature for vararg functions. The original code did not correctly handle cases where the index was negative and within the range of negation overflow, causing a miscalculation of the position (`pos`) that should be accessed, potentially leading to memory corruption or a segmentation fault when accessing memory out of bounds.

The patch addresses this issue by changing the condition to check if `n` is greater than or equal to the negation of `nextra` (the number of extra arguments), and adjusting the calculation of `*pos` accordingly. This prevents the negation overflow by correctly handling the case where `n` is a large negative number and ensuring that the calculation of the position to access remains within valid bounds. Additionally, the update in `luaG_findlocal` from returning `findvararg(ci, -n, pos)` to `findvararg(ci, n, pos)` when `n < 0` makes the handling consistent with the updated check and calculation logic in `findvararg`. 

In conclusion, the root cause was improper handling of negation and index calculations for vararg access, leading to potential overflow and undefined behavior. The patch corrects this by ensuring safe and correct calculations even when dealing with negative indices.
