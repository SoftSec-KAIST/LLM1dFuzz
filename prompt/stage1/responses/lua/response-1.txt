The root cause of CVE-2020-24370 is a negation overflow issue in Lua 5.4.0, specifically within its debugging tools provided in the `ldebug.c` file. This issue impacts the `getlocal` and `setlocal` functions, which provide functionality for accessing and mutating local variables within a Lua script during its execution.

The problem arises when these functions attempt to negate a very large integer, such as `2^31`. In programming, integer types often have a maximum value they can represent. When an operation causes the integer value to exceed this maximum (or in this case, when negating, to exceed the minimum representable value), an overflow occurs. In many systems, a signed 32-bit integer can range from -2^31 to 2^31-1. Negating a -2^31 cannot be represented within a 32-bit signed integer, leading to undefined behavior, which, as reported, manifests as a negation overflow resulting in a segmentation fault. A segmentation fault is a specific kind of error caused by accessing memory that "does not belong" to the program, which indicates that due to the overflow, the program's logic is corrupted, leading to an attempt to access an incorrect memory address.

By reviewing the patch, we see that the Lua team fixed this issue by adjusting the condition check within the `findvararg` function to ensure that it correctly handles the scenario when `n` is negative and within a valid range, devoid of causing an overflow by negating a large positive number that results in a number out of the bounds of what an integer can represent.

The change from checking if `n` is less or equal to `nextra` to checking if `n` is greater than or equal to `-nextra` for the negative case, and the adjustment from `-n` to `n` in the condition and logic for calculating the position (`*pos`), corrects how the indices are calculated and accessed, ensuring that it appropriately deals with large or negative numbers without causing an overflow or incorrect memory access. This adjustment addresses the root cause by ensuring the code logic safely manages the range of valid indices, thereby preventing segmentation faults arising from negation overflow.
