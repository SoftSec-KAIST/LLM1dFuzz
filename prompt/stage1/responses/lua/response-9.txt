The root cause of CVE-2020-24370 in Lua 5.4.0 involves an integer overflow issue in the `getlocal` and `setlocal` functions, as used in the debugging functionality (`ldebug.c`). Specifically, the vulnerability arises from the mishandling of large, specially crafted values passed to these functions, which can lead to a negation overflow. 

In Lua, the `getlocal` and `setlocal` functions allow the inspection and modification of local variables during runtime debugging. The issue occurs when these functions are called with an excessively large index value (e.g., 2^31), which, due to integer arithmetic rules in C, can cause the calculation to overflow and wrap around to a negative value. When a negative index value is not correctly handled or anticipated by the application code, it can lead to out-of-bounds memory access. This, in turn, can cause a segmentation fault, resulting in a crash of the Lua interpreter.

The provided patch addresses this vulnerability by changing the conditionals in both the `findvararg` function and the `luaG_findlocal` function. These changes ensure that the application correctly handles situations where `n` is negative, preventing the overflow condition. The alteration in the `findvararg` function from `if (n <= nextra)` to `if (n >= -nextra)` explicitly handles cases where `n` is negative, thus preventing the negation overflow by correctly calculating the position of the vararg. Similarly, the adjusted call of `findvararg(ci, n, pos)` in `luaG_findlocal` ensures that a negative `n` can be directly passed and correctly dealt with, rather than attempting to negate it again (which could contribute to the overflow issue).

Therefore, the root cause of CVE-2020-24370 is primarily due to improper handling of large index values that, when negated, exceed the bounds of integer types, leading to a segmentation fault. The patch corrects this by ensuring that negative index values are handled in a way that avoids the overflow and correctly identifies the memory location of variables to be accessed or modified.
