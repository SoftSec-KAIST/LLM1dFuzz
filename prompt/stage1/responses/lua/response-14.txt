The root cause of CVE-2020-24370 in Lua 5.4.0 resides in the negation overflow issue within the handling of the `getlocal` and `setlocal` functions in `ldebug.c`. When these functions attempt to handle very large negative numbers, specifically when trying to negate the minimum value representable by an integer (e.g., `2^31` in a 32-bit system, which is `-2^31`), it causes an overflow. Integer overflow is a condition where an arithmetic operation attempts to create a numeric value that is outside of the range that can be represented with a given number of digits â€“ either higher than the maximum or lower than the minimum representable value.

In this specific case, the issue is further highlighted by the fact that in C, the range of signed integers is asymmetric. For a 32-bit signed integer, the range is from `-2147483648` to `2147483647`. When you try to negate `-2147483648`, the result cannot be represented as a 32-bit signed integer, leading to an overflow. This behavior, when not correctly handled, can result in undefined behavior, crashes, or even security vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows or arbitrary code execution, depending on the context. In the case of CVE-2020-24370, it leads to a segmentation fault, which is a type of crash.

The patch addresses this issue by changing the logic in `findvararg` and `luaG_findlocal` functions to correctly handle cases where `n` is negative, thus avoiding the problematic negation in scenarios that would lead to an overflow. Specifically, it adjusts the conditions and arithmetic involving `n` to ensure that the operations remain within the bounds of representable values, preventing the overflow and the resultant segmentation fault from occurring. This is done by changing the condition to check if `n` is greater than or equal to `-nextra` and adjusting the calculation of the position `*pos` accordingly, ensuring that the computation does not try to negate the minimum integer value.
