The root cause of CVE-2020-24370 in Lua 5.4.0 revolves around a negation overflow issue within the `getlocal` and `setlocal` functions. The code handling these functions was susceptible to an overflow when a very large number (specifically, 2^31, which is on the border of the range for signed 32-bit integers) was negated. This issue could lead to a segmentation fault, which is a type of crash that occurs when a program attempts to access memory that it's not supposed to. Such faults can lead to program instability and could potentially be exploited to execute arbitrary code, depending on the context and other factors.

Looking closely at the patch, the main changes were made in the way negated numbers are handled. Originally, there was a direct check for the negated number's comparison with `nextra` (the number of extra arguments in a vararg Lua function). The code did not properly account for cases where the negated number might cause an overflow, leading to incorrect memory access and, hence, a segmentation fault.

The patch addressed this issue by changing the condition from checking if `n <= nextra` to `n >= -nextra` for a scenario where `n` is negative, indicating a request to access vararg (variable number of arguments) values in reverse. This adjustment properly accounts for negative numbers without leading to an overflow. Additionally, the corrected logic ensures that the calculation based on negative `n` results in the correct memory address being used to access the intended local variable.

In summary, the root cause was an oversight in handling very large negative numbers, which could result in an integer overflow and unintended memory access. The provided patch fixes this by safely handling negative indices to avoid negation overflow, ensuring that memory accesses stay within valid bounds.
