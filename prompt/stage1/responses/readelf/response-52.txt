The root cause of CVE-2017-16828 in GNU Binutils 2.29.1, as indicated by the patch and the description of the issue, was an integer overflow problem resulting from handling ELF files with corrupt augmentation data. Specifically, the issue occurred within the `display_debug_frames` function in `dwarf.c` during the processing of ELF files. The vulnerability was triggered when handling augmentation data lengths that could result in an integer overflow. This overflow, in turn, could lead to a heap-based buffer over-read and, consequently, a denial of service via application crash. In certain scenarios, it could potentially lead to other unspecified impacts.

From the patch provided, we see several key changes aimed at addressing this vulnerability:

1. **Data Type Change for Handle Larger Values Properly**: The data type for the variable `augmentation_data_len` was changed from `unsigned long` to `bfd_size_type` within the function `read_cie`. This change was made to handle larger values appropriately, reducing the risk of overflow when working with the length of augmentation data.

2. **Integer Overflow Check**: The patch introduces checks for integer overflow conditions when working with the length of augmentation data. Specifically, it checks whether the `augmentation_data_len` exceeds the available data buffer size. If it does, it now generates a warning and prevents further processing, thus avoiding the overflow.

3. **Introduction of `display_augmentation_data` Function**: A new function `display_augmentation_data` was added to safely and more efficiently display the contents of the augmentation data array, adhering to the correct format and size considerations. This function likely contributes to safer handling of augmentation data by centralizing its processing and potentially reducing code duplication.

4. **Use of Safe Data Types and Checks**: The use of `bfd_size_type` and the explicit checking of sizes and bounds throughout the modified functions imply a systemic approach to prevent both overflows and under-reads/-writes.

The essence of the vulnerability was improper handling of input leading to unsafe memory operations. The patch mitigates this by ensuring that data sizes are appropriately managed and checked, thus preventing the integer overflow and its consequent memory mismanagement from occurring.
