Based on the CVE-2017-16828 description and the provided patch details, the root cause of this vulnerability appears to be an integer overflow that leads to a heap-based buffer over-read situation in the GNU Binutils' handling of ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) files, particularly within the display_debug_frames function and related routines in `dwarf.c`.

More specifically, the vulnerability happens because the `augmentation_data_len` (which stores the length of certain data within a debug section of an ELF file) was previously declared as an unsigned long (which can vary in size depending on the architecture, but the critical issue here is more about its handling rather than its size directly). This variable could overflow if the ELF file contains specially crafted (perhaps maliciously) large values, and this overflow could, in turn, cause reads beyond the buffer allocated for storing this augmentation data.

To address the vulnerability, the following actions were taken in the patch:

1. **Change of Data Type**: The type of `augmentation_data_len` was changed to `bfd_size_type` from unsigned long. `bfd_size_type` is presumably more appropriate for handling data sizes consistently across different architectures, reducing the risk of overflow.

2. **Bounds Checking**: The patch adds more robust checks for data lengths, notably verifying that the `augmentation_data_len` does not exceed the expected bounds when read from an ELF file. This inclusion of bounds checking is crucial for preventing the overflow and ensuring that the application does not attempt to read beyond the allocated buffer.

3. **Refactoring for Clarity and Safety**: By introducing a new function `display_augmentation_data()` for handling the printing of augmentation data, the patch not only centralizes this functionality (making future maintenance and updates easier) but also inherently makes it a bit safer in how it handles the iteration over the augmentation data bytes. This function takes into account the maximum print length to avoid issues related to buffer handling in the context of displaying data.

The root cause, therefore, is a mixture of insufficient validation (no proper bounds checking before using the augmentation data length) and unsafe handling of input data (using a data type that may be susceptible to overflow without proper checks in place). The patch correctly addresses these issues by implementing appropriate checks, adopting a more suitable data type, and refactoring code to enhance safety and readability.
