The root cause of CVE-2017-16828 in GNU Binutils 2.29.1, as extrapolated from the patch, appears to be an integer overflow vulnerability located in the handling of ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) files, specifically within the functions for processing DWARF debugging information. Letâ€™s break down the key points leading to this conclusion:

1. **Integer Overflow and Buffer Over-read:** The description mentions that a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability by causing an integer overflow which leads to a heap-based buffer over-read. This indicates that the software is attempting to read more data from a buffer than has been allocated for it, which is a classic sign of an integer overflow not properly handling the sizes of the data it processes.

2. **Vulnerable Function - `display_debug_frames`:** The function indicated to have the issue is `display_debug_frames`, which is responsible for parsing and displaying debug frames from ELF files. This function, among others, utilizes values that are derived from the user-provided ELF files, making it critical to correctly process and validate these values.

3. **Patch Analysis:**
   - The patch involves changing the type of `augmentation_data_len` from `unsigned long` to `bfd_size_type`. This change likely serves to ensure that the data type used for the length is consistent and appropriate across different platforms and architectures, potentially offering a wider or more correctly sized type to handle the data lengths involved.
   - Furthermore, the patch adds checks for integer overflow when dealing with `augmentation_data_len`. This directly addresses the core issue by validating the length of the augmentation data against potential overflow, which would previously lead to the described vulnerability.
   - The introduction of `display_augmentation_data` as a new function abstracts the handling and displaying of augmentation data, which might also include more controlled and safer processing of this data.

In summary, the root cause of CVE-2017-16828 seems to be an integer overflow vulnerability occurring from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data lengths within ELF files. This flaw could allow for buffer over-read situations by incorrectly calculating sizes for memory operations. The provided patch corrects this by ensuring safer data type usage and adding explicit checks against overflow conditions, thereby mitigating the risk of exploitability of this vulnerability.
