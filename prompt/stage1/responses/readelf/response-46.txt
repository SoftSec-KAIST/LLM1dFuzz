The root cause of CVE-2017-16828 in GNU Binutils 2.29.1, as detailed in the provided patch, is related to an integer overflow vulnerability in the handling of augmentation data within ELF files. Specifically, the issue stems from improper validation and manipulation of augmentation data length when reading and displaying ELF file debugging information.

Here's a breakdown of the root issues addressed by the patch:

1. **Use of improper type for `augmentation_data_len`**: Previously, `augmentation_data_len` was declared as an `unsigned long`, which could lead to integer overflow issues when handling specially crafted ELF files. The patch changes this variable to `bfd_size_type`, a type specifically designed to represent sizes within the Binary File Descriptor library used by Binutils, offering a more robust and appropriately sized datatype for handling file sizes and addressing potential integer overflow.

2. **Insufficient validation of `augmentation_data_len`**: Before the patch, there were insufficient checks to ensure that the `augmentation_data_len` did not exceed the bounds of what is logically expected or physically possible within the ELF file structure. The patch introduces comprehensive bounds checking to prevent reading beyond the intended buffer, which could lead to a heap-based buffer over-read, and in turn, denial of service or potentially other unspecified impacts.

3. **Introduction of `display_augmentation_data` function**: To consolidate and correctly handle the printing of augmentation data, the patch introduces a new function, `display_augmentation_data`. This function is designed to safely display the contents of the augmentation data array, taking into account the correct length of the data and ensuring that output respects the boundaries of data storage, thus mitigating the risk of misuse of the data length that could contribute to vulnerabilities.

The primary goals of the patch are to safeguard against the misuse of ELF file contents that could trigger an integer overflow, ensure that all operations respect the bounds of allocated memory, and prevent malicious actors from exploiting the vulnerabilities to cause denial of service or other harmful impacts. These modifications collectively mitigate the risks associated with processing malformed or maliciously crafted ELF files, enhancing the security of the GNU Binutils package.
