The root cause of CVE-2017-16828 in the GNU Binutils 2.29.1 relates to improper handling of Enhanced Debugging Format (ELF) files, specifically within the handling of Dwarf debug information. By analyzing the patch details, the core issues can be distilled as follows:

1. **Integer Overflow During Augmentation Data Length Calculation**: The original code used a type (`unsigned long`) for the `augmentation_data_len` variable, which could lead to an integer overflow situation when interpreting maliciously crafted ELF files. This overflow occurs because the read value for augmentation data length could be larger than what can be accurately held by the variable, especially considering the variable's type and the system's architecture where Binutils is running.

2. **Heap-based Buffer Over-read**: As a consequence of the integer overflow, the code could attempt to read beyond the allocated bounds of a heap buffer. This is due to it incorrectly calculating the length of the augmentation data and consequently accessing memory out of bounds of the intended heap buffer. Such over-read can lead to a Denial of Service (crashing the application) and potentially could be exploited to leak information or lead to other unspecified impacts due to the manipulation of the corrupted data read.

3. **Inadequate Data Type for Length Representation**: The patch changes the data type of `augmentation_data_len` from `unsigned long` to `bfd_size_type`, a variable type more suited for representing sizes offset within binary files handled by `libbfd`. This change is crucial in preventing the integer overflow as `bfd_size_type` is meant to be capable of representing any file offset or size accurately, adhering to the context of file manipulations, including potentially large files.

4. **Lack of Proper Validation**: The original code did not adequately validate the augmentation data length against the actual size of the remaining data buffer (`end - start`). The patch introduces a validation step to prevent processing if the determined length exceeds the size of available data, addressing the situation where the augmentation dataâ€™s reported length could cause reads beyond the valid data range, preventing potential buffer over-read scenarios.

In summary, the primary root cause was improper validation and inadequate data type choice for handling sizes and lengths within ELF files, leading to integer overflows and possible buffer over-reads. The patch addresses these issues by ensuring more suitable data types are used for length representation (`bfd_size_type`) and by inserting checks to validate the augmentation data length against the available buffer size, thereby mitigating the risk of exploiting these vulnerabilities.
