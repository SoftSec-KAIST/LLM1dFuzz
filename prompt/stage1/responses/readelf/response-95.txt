The root cause of CVE-2017-16828 in GNU Binutils 2.29.1 relates to an integer overflow vulnerability in the handling of augmentation data within ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) files. This oversight occurs specifically within the `display_debug_frames` function in `dwarf.c`. When the utility reads and processes corrupt or specially crafted ELF files, it may encounter augmentation data lengths that exceed the expected size limits. The original code did not sufficiently check for these excessive lengths, potentially leading to an integer overflow. This overflow, in turn, could cause a heap-based buffer over-read, where the application reads beyond the allocated buffer. Such behavior can lead to a denial of service (application crash) due to the application attempting to access memory outside of its allocated heap space. Moreover, this vulnerability might also enable attackers to have an unspecified impact, which could range from information disclosure to arbitrary code execution, depending on the nature of the over-read data and the application's context.

The specific patch addresses this issue by:

1. Changing the data type for `augmentation_data_len` from `unsigned long` to `bfd_size_type`. This modification ensures that the data type used to represent augmentation data lengths is consistent and appropriate, potentially offering a wider range of values to prevent overflow.

2. Adding checks for integer overflow when assessing `augmentation_data_len`. This includes verifying that the calculated length of the augmentation data does not exceed the bounds of the remaining data to be processed (`end - start`). It also introduces safeguards against negative values and scenarios where the augmentation data pointer would surpass the expected end of the data, which indicates corrupt augmentation data lengths.

3. Refactoring the code to separate the logic for displaying augmentation data into its own function `display_augmentation_data`, improving readability and maintainability.

The patch correctly identifies the issues surrounding the manipulation and checking of augmentation data lengths, mitigating the immediate overflow concern by ensuring that the data lengths are properly validated before use, thus preventing possible buffer over-read scenarios and their associated crashes or exploitable conditions.
