The root cause of CVE-2017-16828 in GNU Binutils 2.29.1, as indicated by the provided patch, is an integer overflow problem when reading an ELF binary with corrupt augmentation data. Specifically, the issue is within the processing of augmentation data in the `dwarf.c` file's `display_debug_frames` function and related functions. The application failed to properly handle an ELF file containing corrupt augmentation data, which could lead to an integer overflow. This overflow, in turn, could result in a heap-based buffer over-read and potentially cause the application to crash, constituting a denial of service (DoS) vulnerability. Additionally, there might be a possibility for other unspecified impacts, which could suggest a vector for exploitation beyond DoS.

The patch addresses this issue by changing the data type used to store the length of the augmentation data from `unsigned long` to `bfd_size_type`. This change is crucial because `bfd_size_type` is better suited for representing sizes and offsets in a way that is safe and consistent across different platforms and architectures, reducing the likelihood of an overflow. The patch also adds checks to ensure that the `augmentation_data_len` does not exceed the expected bounds, and it properly introduces error handling for cases where the augmentation data length is corrupt (e.g., too long or causing buffer overflows).

Summarily, the root cause is attributed to inadequate data type choices and insufficient validation and error handling when processing potentially malicious input files. The patch corrects these issues by adopting more suitable data types and adding comprehensive checks and error handling mechanisms.
