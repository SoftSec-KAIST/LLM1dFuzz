Based on the given information about CVE-2017-16828 and the details of the patch, the root cause of the vulnerability was an integer overflow issue in the handling of augmentation data length when reading ELF binaries with corrupt augmentation data.

In GNU Binutils 2.29.1, within the `dwarf.c` file, particularly in the `display_debug_frames` function (and related functions), there was insufficient validation of the size of augmentation data obtained from an ELF file. This lack of validation could lead to an integer overflow when the size was specified as larger than the actual available data. This condition could lead to a heap-based buffer over-read or an application crash due to attempting to access memory beyond the allocated heap buffer, forming the basis for a potential Denial of Service (DoS) attack. Additionally, due to the nature of this flaw, it might have been possible for attackers to leverage this vulnerability to have unspecified other impacts, although those were not detailed in the CVE description.

The specific issue was related to the handling of the `augmentation_data_len` variable, which was originally declared as an `unsigned long` type. This could lead to situations where, if provided with specially crafted ELF augmentation data, an attacker could cause the application to misinterpret the size of the data to be processed, leading to memory management errors.

The patch addressed this vulnerability by making several key changes:

1. Changing the type of `augmentation_data_len` from `unsigned long` to `bfd_size_type` in the `read_cie` function. This change was likely made to ensure that the data length variable has a size appropriate to the platform and the context in which it's used, potentially reducing the risk of overflow.

2. Introducing additional validations to check for integer overflow conditions when processing augmentation data lengths. This involved adding checks to ensure that the specified length of augmentation data does not exceed the actual amount of data available between the current reading position and the end of the ELF section being read.

3. Adding a new function `display_augmentation_data` to properly and safely display the contents of the augmentation data array, factoring in the improvements made to handle augmentation data lengths safely.

These changes collectively mitigate the risk of integer overflow and the resultant heap-based buffer over-read scenarios by introducing more robust type usage and validation checks, thereby preventing attackers from exploiting the previously present vulnerability in the handling of ELF augmentation data in GNU Binutils.
