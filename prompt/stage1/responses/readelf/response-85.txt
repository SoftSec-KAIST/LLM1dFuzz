The root cause of CVE-2017-16828 in GNU Binutils 2.29.1 stems from an integer overflow vulnerability. This issue occurs when the software, specifically within the `display_debug_frames` function in `dwarf.c`, processes maliciously crafted ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) files. These ELF files could contain corrupt augmentation data leading to an integer overflow.

The integer overflow arises due to the software improperly handling the length of augmentation data (denoted as `augmentation_data_len` in the patch). Originally, this length variable was of a type that could not safely handle extremely large sizes, which are not uncommon in corrupt or intentionally malformed ELF files. When the software attempts to read or process this overly large augmentation data length value, it can result in an integer overflow. This overflow, in turn, leads to a heap-based buffer over-read, where the application reads data past the end of the allocated heap buffer. Such over-reads can cause a crash, resulting in a denial of service condition. Additionally, depending on the nature of the data read and how it is used subsequently by the application, there might be potential for further unspecified impacts.

To address this vulnerability, the patch changes the data type of `augmentation_data_len` from `unsigned long` to `bfd_size_type`, which is better suited for safely handling the sizes of data segments in ELF files, even when they are corrupt or have been tampered with to exploit this vulnerability. Moreover, the patched code includes more robust checking for integer overflow when dealing with the augmentation data length. It introduces sanity checks to ensure that the calculated length does not exceed the bounds of the memory buffer allocated for the augmentation data, and it properly handles scenarios where the calculated start of the augmentation data would end up past the end of the allocated buffer, both of which are indicative of corrupt or malicious ELF files. 

By implementing these changes, the patch prevents the possibility of integer overflow, thereby mitigating the risk of heap-based buffer over-reads, application crashes, and potentially other impacts when processing malformed ELF files.
