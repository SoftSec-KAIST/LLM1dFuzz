The root cause of CVE-2017-16828 in GNU Binutils 2.29.1, as analyzed from the provided patch, can be attributed to an integer overflow vulnerability. This vulnerability is present in the handling of augmentation data length in the display_debug_frames function within dwarf.c, which deals with DWARF debugging information. When processing a crafted ELF file's augmentation data, an inadequately sized data type (`unsigned long`) was used to store the augmentation data length. This choice could lead to situations where the size of the augmentation data could exceed the capacity of the `unsigned long` type, particularly on platforms where this type has a smaller maximum value, leading to an integer overflow.

The integer overflow could further manifest as a heap-based buffer over-read because the system could misinterpret the overflowed augmentation data length value. This misinterpretation could cause the system to attempt to read beyond the bounds of the allocated heap memory when attempting to process the augmentation data, potentially leading to a denial of service (application crash) or possibly other unspecified impacts such as the execution of malicious code if the over-read data is used in a manner that alters the program's execution flow.

The patch addresses this issue by switching the data type used to store the augmentation data length from `unsigned long` to `bfd_size_type`. The `bfd_size_type` is a more appropriately sized type, designed to safely handle sizes for objects within the Binary File Descriptor (bfd) library, which GNU Binutils uses for handling binary data in a portable way. By ensuring the data type can accommodate larger sizes without overflowing, the patch mitigates the risk of integer overflow and the associated potential for heap-based buffer over-reads.

Additionally, the patch introduces better safety checks around the augmentation data length to further protect against potentially malicious data inducing an overflow. The implementation of `display_augmentation_data`, a new function, suggests an effort to modularize and perhaps safely encapsulate the handling and displaying of augmentation data, which may help prevent similar issues in the future by centralizing data handling logic.
