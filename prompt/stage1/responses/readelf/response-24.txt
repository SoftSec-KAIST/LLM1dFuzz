The root cause of CVE-2017-16828 in GNU Binutils 2.29.1, as indicated by the description and the patch details, revolves around an integer overflow issue when handling crafted ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) files, specifically within the `display_debug_frames` function in `dwarf.c`. This vulnerability could lead to a denial of service (DoS) through a heap-based buffer over-read and application crash, or possibly other, unspecified impacts.

Analyzing the patch, we understand that Binutils did not adequately safeguard against integer overflow for a variable (`augmentation_data_len`) that represents the length of augmentation data in ELF files. This variable's type was initially an unsigned long, which could overflow when manipulated with values from a maliciously crafted ELF file, leading to incorrect computations that affect memory operations.

The patch corrects this vulnerability in several ways:

1. **Type Change for `augmentation_data_len`**: The type of `augmentation_data_len` is changed from `unsigned long` to `bfd_size_type`. The `bfd_size_type` is likely a larger (or more appropriately sized) data type compared to `unsigned long`, designed to safely hold sizes of file sections without overflowing.

2. **Integer Overflow Check**: It adds checks for integer overflow when calculating the augmentation data length. This is an essential safety check that prevents the software from proceeding with corrupted or deliberately malformed data that could lead to overflows and subsequent memory corruption or access violations.

3. **Introduction of `display_augmentation_data` Function**: To streamline and standardize the processing and displaying of augmentation data, a new function `display_augmentation_data` is introduced. This function not only separates concerns, making the code more maintainable, but it also likely incorporates safer practices for handling and displaying the data.

4. **Error Checking Enhancements**: Improved error checking on `augmentation_data_len` to ensure that the length specified in the ELF file does not exceed the available data size, preventing reads beyond the buffer's end.

The root cause, therefore, stems from improper handling of external input (in this case, augmentation data length from ELF files) without adequate validation and type safety, leading to a vulnerability where crafted input could overflow an integer and cause incorrect memory operations. This flaw could be exploited by attackers to crash the application or potentially execute arbitrary code through carefully crafted ELF files. The patch addresses this by enhancing type safety, adding overflow checks, and improving the handling and validation of the augmentation data length.
