The root cause of CVE-2017-16828 in GNU Binutils 2.29.1 involves an integer overflow issue within the handling of ELF files, particularly in the display_debug_frames function in dwarf.c. This vulnerability stems from the improper handling of augmentation data length in the Debug Information Entry (DIE) processing logic. The specific problems are:

1. **Improper Data Type for Length Handling**: The original code used an `unsigned long` to represent `augmentation_data_len`, which could lead to an integer overflow when very large or specially crafted values are encountered. This overflow could potentially allow an attacker to cause a buffer over-read, leading to a denial of service (application crash) or possibly other, unspecified impacts. The issue is pertinent when malicious actors craft ELF files with intentionally corrupt augmentation data designed to exploit this vulnerability.

2. **Insufficient Validation**: Before the patch, the code did not correctly verify the length of the augmentation data against the expected bounds. If the `augmentation_data_len` was crafted to be larger than what is actually available in the buffer (`end - start`), it would lead to out-of-bounds access. This vulnerability arises from a failure to ensure that `augmentation_data_len` does not surpass the size of the data buffer it refers to.

The vulnerabilities are addressed in the provided patch in several ways:

- The `augmentation_data_len` variable and related computations have been changed to use `bfd_size_type` instead of `unsigned long`. `bfd_size_type` is presumably chosen for being more suitable in handling sizes of file contents or data objects, potentially offering a wider range of values to safely represent the size of augmentation data without overflowing.

- The patch introduces better validation checks. For example, it ensures that `augmentation_data_len` is not larger than the remaining buffer space (`end - start`), which directly addresses the possibility of an overflow and subsequent buffer over-read by adding a condition that checks this scenario.

- The addition of the `display_augmentation_data` function improves the handling and displaying of augmentation data. This not only makes the code cleaner but also centralizes the logic for handling augmentation data, making it easier to maintain and secure against possible overflow or invalid data length scenarios.

In conclusion, the primary root causes of CVE-2017-16828 revolve around inadequate type size for handling lengths, leading to integer overflow, and a lack of proper validation for data sizes, resulting in potential buffer over-read scenarios. The supplied patch addresses these issues by changing data types to more appropriate ones, adding robust validation, and refining the logic to handle augmentation data, all of which help mitigate the risk of exploiting this vulnerability.
