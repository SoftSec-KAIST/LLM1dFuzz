The root cause of CVE-2017-16828 in GNU Binutils 2.29.1 seems to be an integer overflow issue within its handling of ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) files, particularly in the context of reading and processing DWARF debug information. This vulnerability specifically exists in the `display_debug_frames` function in `dwarf.c`, which is used to parse and display DWARF debug frames contained within an ELF file.

The details indicate that the issue stems from inadequately handling the length of augmentation data associated with DWARF Call Frame Information Entries (CIE) or Frame Description Entries (FDE). When the function reads the length of the augmentation data, it previously used an unsigned long type for `augmentation_data_len`, which could lead to integer overflow if the ELF file contains crafted (malicious or corrupted) augmentation data. An overflow could cause the program to read beyond the buffer allocated for the augmentation data (`heap-based buffer over-read`), leading to a crash (`denial of service`) or potentially enabling other unspecified impacts (which might include executing arbitrary code if the circumstances allow).

In response to this vulnerability, the patch addresses the problem by changing the type of `augmentation_data_len` from `unsigned long` to `bfd_size_type`, which is more appropriate for handling sizes within the Binutils infrastructure and can help properly manage large or unexpected sizes. Moreover, the patch includes various checks throughout the reading process to validate that the augmentation data length does not exceed the expected bounds, avoiding the integer overflow. Functions like `read_cie` and `display_debug_frames` were updated to utilize this new type and incorporate checks for overflow conditions.

Additionally, the introduction of the `display_augmentation_data` function centralizes the display logic for augmentation data, facilitating better control over how this data is handled and presented, which may indirectly help in mitigating risks of misinterpreting the sizes of data to be displayed.

In summary, the root cause is the insufficient handling of the size (length) of augmentation data in DWARF information, leading to an integer overflow vulnerability. The patch corrects this by using a more suitable data type for sizes, adding checks for overflow, and refining the logic for displaying augmentation data.
