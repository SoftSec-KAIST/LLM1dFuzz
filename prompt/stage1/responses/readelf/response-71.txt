The root cause of CVE-2017-16828 in GNU Binutils 2.29.1, as indicated by the patch, involves several critical issues related to how augmentation data length is handled when reading an ELF binary file:

1. **Integer Overflow:** Prior to the patch, augmentation data length (`augmentation_data_len`) was represented using an `unsigned long` data type. In scenarios where the ELF file contains corrupt augmentation data, reading this data could lead to an integer overflow. This is because an `unsigned long` might not be capable of holding large values correctly on all platforms, especially on platforms where the size of `unsigned long` is smaller than the size of pointers or indices used to navigate the buffer. The overflow can result in incorrect calculations of buffer sizes or indices, leading to buffer over-reads.

2. **Heap-Based Buffer Over-Read:** The consequence of the integer overflow was a heap-based buffer over-read. This occurs when the program reads beyond the allocated buffer, potentially accessing and exposing sensitive data from adjacent memory or causing the program to crash due to accessing invalid memory regions. The over-read was facilitated by the incorrect handling of the augmentation data length, which, if corrupt, could specify a length that exceeds the actual size of the buffer. This could lead inspectors of the ELF file to unintentionally read beyond the intended boundary.

3. **Incorrect Data-Type for Length:** The patch addresses these issues by changing the data type of `augmentation_data_len` from `unsigned long` to `bfd_size_type`. This change ensures that the size type is consistent with the platform's addressable memory space, thus mitigating the risk of an integer overflow when dealing with potentially large values. 

4. **Additional Validity Checks:** The patch also introduces checks for integer overflow when testing `augmentation_data_len`. This involves comparing the specified length of augmentation data against the remaining buffer size before proceeding with the read operation. It helps prevent scenarios where the specified length could lead to buffer over-reads by ensuring the length is within a valid range.

5. **Refactoring and Code Enhancement:** To improve code readability and maintenance, a new function `display_augmentation_data` was introduced. This function encapsulates the logic for displaying the augmentation data, adhering to the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle and making future modifications easier and less error-prone.

In summary, the root cause of CVE-2017-16828 was improper handling of augmentation data length in ELF files, leading to potential integer overflows and buffer over-reads. The patch addressed these vulnerabilities by changing data types to better accommodate memory sizes and adding checks to ensure the integrity and validity of the augmentation data length.
