The root cause of CVE-2017-16828 in GNU Binutils 2.29.1, as detailed by the provided patch, stems from an integer overflow issue when handling augmentation data length during the processing of a crafted ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) file. Specifically, the vulnerability occurs in the `display_debug_frames` function in `dwarf.c`, where the program calculates the length of augmentation data from an ELF file's debugging information.

1. **Integer Overflow Vulnerability:** The original implementation used an `unsigned long` type to store the augmentation data length. If an attacker provided a crafted ELF file with specifically designed augmentation data length values, it could lead to an integer overflow. This overflow could then result in a heap-based buffer over-read or even a denial of service (DoS) through application crash. There was also a potential for other unspecified impacts, likely depending on how the overflowed values were used after the fact, which could theoretically include code execution scenarios in more contrived circumstances.


2. **Improper Validation of Augmentation Data Length:** The patch notes indicate that before the fix, there was insufficient validation of the augmentation data length against the actual size of the ELF file's data. This lack of checking could allow an attacker to specify an augmentation data length that was larger than the actual available data, leading to a buffer over-read.

The patch addresses these issues by:

- Changing the data type of `augmentation_data_len` from `unsigned long` to `bfd_size_type`. `bfd_size_type` is likely a larger data type, providing a wider range that helps prevent overflow. Moreover, it's a type more consistent with buffer sizes, enhancing portability and safety regarding memory operations.

- Introducing a new function `display_augmentation_data` to encapsulate the safe printing of augmentation data. This function likely includes improvements in handling the length and display of data, contributing to preventing overflows and over-reads.

- Adding checks for integer overflow when testing `augmentation_data_len`. These checks compare the specified augmentation data length against the remaining size of the data buffer, ensuring that the declared length does not exceed what is actually available, thereby preventing a potential over-read.

In summary, the root cause was the lack of proper validation and safe handling of externally provided augmentation data lengths, leading to potential integer overflows and buffer over-reads when processing malformed ELF files. The fix corrects these issues by enhancing data type safety, validating data lengths against actual sizes, and more safely managing the output of debugging information.
