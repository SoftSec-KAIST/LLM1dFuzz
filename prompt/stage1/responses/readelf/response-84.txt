The root cause of CVE-2017-16828 in GNU Binutils 2.29.1, as implicated by the patch, is an integer overflow vulnerability linked to the handling of augmentation data within ELF files. Specifically, the issues arise in how GNU Binutils' `read_cie` function in `dwarf.c` processes augmentation data length. Here's a breakdown based on the provided patch summary:

1. **Type of Variable for Length**: The patch changes the type of the variable `augmentation_data_len` from `unsigned long` to `bfd_size_type`. This adjustment suggests that the original type might have been inappropriate for securely handling the lengths of augmentation data, potentially leading to overflows due to mismatched size expectations between different platforms or compiler implementations.

2. **Integer Overflow Check**: The patch includes alterations to perform explicit checks for integer overflow conditions. Specifically, it carefully checks if `augmentation_data_len` exceeds the expected maximum based on the difference between the start and end pointers (`end - start`). This modification indicates that before the patch, the code didn't properly verify that the length of the augmentation data read from an ELF file wouldn't result in accessing memory outside the intended bounds (buffer over-read).

3. **Safe Handling of Augmentation Data**: The patch introduces a new function, `display_augmentation_data`, to encapsulate the logic for displaying augmentation data. This refactor suggests an emphasis on centralizing and safely managing the processing of augmentation data in a way that respects the bounds of allocated memory, potentially reducing the scope for mistakes that could lead to exploitable conditions.

4. **Preventive Measures in Debug Data Display**: Modifications in how augmentation data length is handled during the debug information display (in the context of `display_debug_frames`) also imply that previously, insufficient validation could have allowed malformed or malicious ELF files to cause crashes (denial of service) or other undefined behaviors by exploiting the way binary data was interpreted.

Overall, the root cause centers on inadequate validation and handling of augmentation data length in ELF files, which could lead to integer overflows. These overflows, in turn, could result in heap-based buffer over-reads, application crashes (denial of service), and potentially further unspecified impacts. The patch addresses these issues by ensuring length variables are of an appropriate type, adding explicit overflow checks, and improving the handling and display of augmentation data to mitigate the risk of exploiting this vulnerability.
