The root cause of CVE-2017-16828 in GNU Binutils 2.29.1 stems from an integer overflow vulnerability. Specifically, this issue arises in the handling of augmentation data within the display_debug_frames function in dwarf.c when processing crafted ELF files. The variable `augmentation_data_len`, which stores the length of augmentation data, was originally of type `unsigned long`. This type was not sufficiently robust to handle cases where the provided augmentation data length could lead to integer overflows. An overflow can happen due to processing specially crafted ELF files containing corrupt augmentation data with lengths that exceed the bounds of what an `unsigned long` can represent correctly, leading to incorrect calculations of buffer sizes.

The problem first manifests when ELF files with corrupt augmentation data are read by the `read_cie` and `display_debug_frames` functions. These functions did not properly check for overflows in the augmentation data length, leading to scenarios where overly large values of augmentation_data_len could cause incorrect memory operations - such as heap-based buffer over-reads. These incorrect memory operations could result in application crashes (denial of service) or potentially allow an attacker to have unspecified impacts on the affected system.

The patch addresses this vulnerability by changing the data type of `augmentation_data_len` from `unsigned long` to `bfd_size_type`, which is a data type more appropriate for handling sizes within the Binutils infrastructure. Moreover, it introduces explicit checks for integer overflow conditions involving `augmentation_data_len`. Specifically, the patch adds validations to ensure that the computed size does not exceed the bounds of what is safe and expected, thereby preventing the overflow from occurring. Additionally, it refactors the way augmentation data is processed and displayed, encapsulating this logic within a new `display_augmentation_data` function for improved clarity and maintenance.

By addressing the integer overflow vulnerability, the patch ensures that Binutils correctly handles ELF files with corrupt or specially crafted augmentation data, thereby mitigating the risk associated with CVE-2017-16828.
