The root cause of CVE-2017-16828 in GNU Binutils 2.29.1 appears to be an integer overflow issue specifically related to handling ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) binary files. This vulnerability arises in the `display_debug_frames` function within `dwarf.c`, which is involved in processing the debug information in ELF files.

From the patch provided, the vulnerability is linked to the handling of augmentation data length within the DWARF debugging information. The original code used an `unsigned long` type for the `augmentation_data_len` variable, but this could lead to integer overflow when a crafted ELF file contains corrupt augmentation data claiming an excessively large length. Such an overflow could lead to improper memory operations, including a heap-based buffer over-read, potentially allowing attackers to crash the application or execute arbitrary code.

To fix the issue, the patch changes the type of `augmentation_data_len` from `unsigned long` to `bfd_size_type`. This data type ensures the handling of sizes can accommodate the needs of the Binary File Descriptor library (BFD), which Binutils relies on for handling different file formats in a consistent manner.

Additionally, the patch introduces checks for integer overflow when calculating the size of augmentation data. Specifically, it validates the augmentation data length against the remaining buffer size, ensuring that it doesn't exceed what's actually available, which prevents the overflow and the potential for out-of-bounds reads. This is crucial for preventing attackers from exploiting the vulnerability to cause a denial of service or other unspecified impacts.

The inclusion of a new function, `display_augmentation_data`, standardizes the way augmentation data is printed and handles it safely, reflecting precautions taken to avoid similar vulnerabilities by ensuring data lengths are properly checked before use.

In summary, the root cause of CVE-2017-16828 is improper validation and handling of lengths associated with augmentation data in ELF files, leading to integer overflow and buffer over-read conditions. The patch addresses these issues by changing the data type for length variables to more appropriate ones, adding checks against buffer overflows, and standardizing data handling to prevent similar vulnerabilities.
