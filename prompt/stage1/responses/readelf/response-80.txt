The root cause of CVE-2017-16828 in GNU Binutils 2.29.1 appears to be related to how augmentation data length is handled when parsing ELF files in the `dwarf.c` component, particularly in the `display_debug_frames` function. An integer overflow issue can occur when reading the length of the augmentation data from a crafted ELF file. This overflow could lead to a heap-based buffer over-read or possibly other impacts like an application crash when the corrupted or excessively large augmentation data length is used to determine memory operations.

From the provided patch details, the fix involves several key changes:

1. **Use of `bfd_size_type` for `augmentation_data_len`**: The type of the variable `augmentation_data_len` was changed from `unsigned long` to `bfd_size_type` in the `read_cie` function and other relevant parts. `bfd_size_type` is likely a more suitable type intended to handle sizes of data structures within binaries, possibly offering a wider range, which helps prevent integer overflows when dealing with large values.

2. **Checked for Integer Overflow**: The patched code added checks for integer overflow conditions. It carefully compared `augmentation_data_len` against the remaining size of the buffer (`end - start`) to ensure that the specified length does not exceed the bounds of the available data. This is crucial for preventing over-reads of the buffer.

3. **Introduction of `display_augmentation_data` Function**: To standardize and safely print augmentation data, a separate function `display_augmentation_data` was introduced. This function includes logic to handle the display of data more securely, including conditions where `do_wide` is not enabled, aiming for safer handling and presentation of what might be corrupted or malicious data.

Overall, the root cause is tied to insufficient validation and inappropriate type handling of the augmentation data length when processing ELF files, which could lead to integer overflows and subsequent memory corruption issues. The patch addresses these issues by improving the robustness of data type usage, adding necessary checks against overflows, and properly managing the display of augmentation data to mitigate the risk of exploiting this vulnerability.
