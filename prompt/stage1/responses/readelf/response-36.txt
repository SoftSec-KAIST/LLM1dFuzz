The root cause of CVE-2017-16828 as identified from the provided patch information seems to be an integer overflow vulnerability in the GNU Binutils' handling of ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) files, specifically within its handling of the debugging information formatted in DWARF. The vulnerability occurs when Binutils tries to read corrupted augmentation data from an ELF file. The issue stems from using an `unsigned long` type for the `augmentation_data_len` variable, which can lead to an overflow when reading augmentation data length. This overflow, in turn, might cause a heap-based buffer over-read or potentially lead to other unspecified impacts such as application crashes.

The patch addresses this vulnerability by:
1. Changing the type of `augmentation_data_len` from `unsigned long` to `bfd_size_type`. This is a more appropriately sized type for handling sizes of data structures and is likely to accommodate larger values more safely, reducing the risk of overflow.
2. Adding checks to ensure that the `augmentation_data_len` does not exceed the expected length. This is done by comparing `augmentation_data_len` against the computed size of the remaining data (`end - start`), preventing the buffer over-read.
3. Introducing a new function, `display_augmentation_data`, for safe and consistent printing of augmentation data. This helps to encapsulate the logic for displaying the augmentation data, making the code cleaner and ensuring that overflow checks or other safety measures are consistently applied whenever augmentation data is displayed.

Additionally, the patched code includes more careful checking and reporting for the cases where `augmentation_data_len` is out of expected bounds, either by being too large or logically incorrect (e.g., indicating a start position beyond the end of the available data). These checks help to prevent scenarios where malformed or malicious ELF files could trigger undesired behavior in utilities that process such files.

Overall, the fix strengthens the error handling and validation process around reading ELF files' augmentation data, thereby mitigating the risk of exploitation through crafted files designed to exploit this integer overflow vulnerability.
