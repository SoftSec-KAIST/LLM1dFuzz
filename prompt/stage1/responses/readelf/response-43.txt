The root cause of CVE-2017-16828 is primarily due to an integer overflow vulnerability in the handling of ELF file augmentations within GNU Binutils 2.29.1. Specifically, the issue occurs in the `display_debug_frames` function in `dwarf.c` when processing augmentation data length for ELF files. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by providing a crafted ELF file designed to trigger an integer overflow. This, in turn, could lead to a heap-based buffer over-read and possibly result in a crash of the application (Denial of Service) or potentially lead to unspecified impacts.

The vulnerability stems from an inappropriate handling of the augmentation data length, where an unsigned long type variable (`augmentation_data_len`) was used without proper validation to ensure that the calculated length does not exceed the actual size of the buffer it points to or the memory bounds. This makes it possible for specially crafted augmentation data lengths in an ELF file to cause an integer overflow.

From the patch details provided, the resolution involves several key changes:

1. Changed the type of `augmentation_data_len` from `unsigned long` to `bfd_size_type`, which is more suitable for holding sizes and addresses in a portable manner across different platforms.

2. Implemented additional checks to validate the `augmentation_data_len` against possible integer overflows. This is crucial to prevent the overflow from occurring by ensuring that the length doesn't go beyond what is expected/allowed.

3. Introduced a new function, `display_augmentation_data`, to handle the printing of augmentation data. This centralized function is used in multiple places, potentially to streamline the code and ensure that the overflow check is consistently applied whenever augmentation data is processed.

4. Added validation that augmentation_data_len does not result in accessing beyond the buffer (`if (augmentation_data_len > (bfd_size_type) (end - start))`) and refined the error and warning messages to better reflect issues with data lengths.

By addressing the integer overflow issue with these code changes, the patch effectively mitigates the risk of exploiting this vulnerability, thereby preventing attackers from causing denial of service or other potential impacts through crafted ELF files.
