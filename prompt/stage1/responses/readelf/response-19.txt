The root cause of CVE-2017-16828 in the GNU Binutils 2.29.1's handling of ELF files was an integer overflow vulnerability. This particular issue arises from an improper handling of augmentation data lengths when processing ELF files' debug information.

By tracing the patch, we observe a few key changes made to fix this vulnerability:

1. **Change of Data Type for `augmentation_data_len`:** The type of `augmentation_data_len` was changed from `unsigned long` to `bfd_size_type`. This modification suggests that the original data type could potentially lead to integer overflows due to its size limitations. `bfd_size_type` is likely chosen for its capacity to handle larger data sizes safely, mitigating the risk of overflows.

2. **Validation of `augmentation_data_len`:** Added checks ensure that `augmentation_data_len` does not exceed the expected bounds. Specifically, the patch introduces a comparison between `augmentation_data_len` and the available data (`end - start`) to ensure the specified length does not go beyond the actual data buffer. This prevents scenarios where an excessively large length could lead to a buffer over-read.

3. **Integer Overflow Check:** The patch includes an overflow check when `augmentation_data_len` is tested, making sure that its value, when compared or used, does not result in integer overflows. This is critical in preventing scenarios where manipulated data lengths could cause erroneous memory accesses.

4. **Dedicated Function for Displaying Augmentation Data (`display_augmentation_data`):** The introduction of a specific function to handle the display of augmentation data encapsulates the logic for dealing with such data, including any necessary safety checks and formatting. Although this change is more about code organization and readability, ensuring that data handling is centralized can also contribute to safer code by providing a single point for applying security-related updates or checks.

The root cause — an integer overflow due to insufficient validation and improper handling of ELF file augmentation data lengths — allows an attacker to craft malicious ELF files that, when processed by vulnerable versions of GNU Binutils, could lead to denial of service (application crash) or potentially other unspecified impacts. The fix addresses this by ensuring proper data type usage, bounds checking, and overflow protection, thereby preventing maliciously crafted file attributes from causing undesired behavior.
