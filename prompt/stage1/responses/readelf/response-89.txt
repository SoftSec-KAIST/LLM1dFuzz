The root cause of CVE-2017-16828 in GNU Binutils 2.29.1 relates to an integer overflow issue within the handling of augmentation data in the ELF file's DWARF debug information, specifically within the `dwarf.c` source file. The function `display_debug_frames`, which is responsible for parsing and displaying DWARF debugging information from ELF files, did not correctly handle cases where the augmentation data length could lead to integer overflow. This oversight made it possible for specifically crafted ELF files to trigger a heap-based buffer over-read or an application crash, potentially opening the door to further unspecified impacts.

This vulnerability is addressed by changing the data type used to represent the augmentation data length from an `unsigned long` to a `bfd_size_type`, and by adding checks to prevent integer overflow when computing or assessing the augmentation data length. The patch introduces a new function, `display_augmentation_data`, to handle the display of augmentation data more safely, and modifies the `read_cie` function to use `bfd_size_type` for `augmentation_data_len`. Additionally, it includes checks to ensure that calculated lengths do not exceed data bounds and introduces more rigorous validations to prevent overflows and underflows which could lead to memory corruption.

These fixes essentially ensure that the software properly validates and handles the sizes of various fields within the debug information, preventing attackers from leveraging integer overflows to cause denial of service or potentially other exploits by submitting malformed ELF files designed to exploit this vulnerability. By adopting a more secure type (`bfd_size_type`) and adding additional checks, Binutils mitigates the risk associated with processing manipulated ELF files that contain corrupt or maliciously crafted augmentation data in their DWARF debugging information.
