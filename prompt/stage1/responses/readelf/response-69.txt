The root cause of CVE-2017-16828 in GNU Binutils 2.29.1 can be attributed to an integer overflow issue that occurs when reading corrupted augmentation data from an ELF file, specifically within the handling of DWARF debugging information. This integer overflow leads to a heap-based buffer over-read, potentially causing a denial of service (application crash) or possibly allowing an attacker to achieve other unspecified impacts. 

The problem arises due to the use of an inappropriate data type (`unsigned long`) for representing the length of the augmentation data (`augmentation_data_len`), which could overflow when very large, unexpected values are encountered in a crafted ELF file. This overflow could result in reading data past the buffer allocated for the augmentation data, thereby leading to memory corruption.

The patch addresses this vulnerability by changing the data type used for `augmentation_data_len` from `unsigned long` to `bfd_size_type`, which is a more suitable type that correctly handles the size of data structures used within the Binutils software. Also, the patch introduces checks for integer overflow when testing `augmentation_data_len`. Additionally, a new function, `display_augmentation_data`, is introduced to properly format and display the contents of the augmentation data, ensuring that the handling of augmentation data is consistent and follows safe memory management practices.

By applying these changes, the patch fortifies GNU Binutils against potential exploits leveraging this integer overflow vulnerability, thereby enhancing the security and stability of applications that rely on Binutils for processing ELF files and DWARF debugging information.
