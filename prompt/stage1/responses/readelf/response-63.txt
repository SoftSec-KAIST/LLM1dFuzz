The root cause of CVE-2017-16828 is primarily an integer overflow issue when handling augmentation data length in GNU Binutils, specifically within its handling of DWARF debugging information in ELF files. The exploitation occurs when GNU Binutils attempts to process corrupt or maliciously crafted ELF files containing DWARF debug information with incorrect augmentation data lengths.

Here's a breakdown of the root cause based on the patch:

1. **Integer Overflow in Augmentation Data Length:** The original code used an `unsigned long` type for `augmentation_data_len`, which represents the length of augmentation data in the DWARF debugging information. This could lead to integer overflow if the ELF file contained very large, corrupted values for augmentation data length, as the addition to calculate space requirements or offsets could wrap around, resulting in incorrect computations.

2. **Heap-Based Buffer Over-Read:** Due to the integer overflow, when the code attempts to read or process the augmentation data based on the overflowed length, it could read beyond the actual allocated buffer. This could lead not only to a Denial of Service (DoS) due to a crash (by accessing invalid memory) but also potentially to the execution of arbitrary code if other memory protections fail or specific conditions are met to exploit this behavior.

3. **Insufficient Validation:** Before the patch, the validation checks were insufficient in ensuring that the `augmentation_data_len` did not exceed the bounds of the data buffer intended for it, leading to potential over-read situations.

The patch addresses these vulnerabilities by:

- **Changing Data Type for Length:** Switching from `unsigned long` to `bfd_size_type` for `augmentation_data_len`. This might not directly prevent overflow, but it is part of a broader strategy to handle data sizes consistently with the types intended for buffer lengths in Binutils, potentially helping to mitigate overflow risks due to type mismatches.

- **Improved Validation Checks:** Adding checks to ensure that `augmentation_data_len` does not cause an overflow when added to other pointers or offsets, and that the resulting lengths do not exceed the expected bounds of the data structure. This prevents processing of ELF files with maliciously crafted lengths that would lead to buffer over-reads.

- **Refactoring for Clarity and Safety:** Introducing a new function `display_augmentation_data` to encapsulate the safe printing/logging of augmentation data, which enriches the code structure for better readability and maintenance, also implying an indirect check on the data being handled.

In summary, CVE-2017-16828 was caused by inadequate handling of exceptional cases for augmentation data lengths in ELF files, leading to integer overflow and possible heap-based buffer over-read, with the potential for a crash or arbitrary code execution. The issues were fixed by improving data length handling, checking, and validation logic.
