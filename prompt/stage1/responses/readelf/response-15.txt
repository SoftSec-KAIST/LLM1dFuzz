The root cause of CVE-2017-16828 in GNU Binutils 2.29.1, as suggested by the patch, relates to an integer overflow problem when reading the augmentation data length from an ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) file. This issue arises in the `display_debug_frames` function in `dwarf.c` due to the way augmentation data length is handled.

In the original code, `augmentation_data_len` was declared as an `unsigned long`, which could lead to integer overflow when reading corrupt augmentation data from an ELF file. The overflow happens because the size of the augmentation data length was not checked against the actual size of the remaining data to be read or against the potential to exceed integer limits, thereby causing an application crash or a potential buffer over-read. A buffer over-read could lead to a denial of service (DoS) by crashing the application or possibly lead to unspecified other impacts, which may include execution of arbitrary code if the vulnerability is exploited successfully.

The patch addresses this vulnerability by changing the type of `augmentation_data_len` from `unsigned long` to `bfd_size_type`, which is intended to safely handle sizes of objects in memory in a portable way across different platforms. Furthermore, the patch introduces checks for integer overflow when handling the augmentation data length. Specifically, the patch adds verification to ensure that the `augmentation_data_len` does not exceed the actual size of the data that follows and does not result in integer overflow, by comparing it against the size of the remaining data and ensuring that the calculation does not wrap around.

Additionally, the patch involves the encapsulation of augmentation data display logic into a new function `display_augmentation_data`, which not only tightens the code for better readability and maintenance but also centralizes the logic for handling augmentation data display, ensuring any adjustments or checks are consistently applied.

Overall, the patch mitigates the risk of integer overflow by introducing safer data type usage and adding necessary checks that validate the size of the augmentation data against possible overflow scenarios, thereby preventing the heap-based buffer over-read and application crash that could be triggered by specially crafted ELF files.
