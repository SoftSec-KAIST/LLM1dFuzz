The root cause of CVE-2017-16828 in GNU Binutils 2.29.1 is primarily due to an integer overflow vulnerability within the handling of ELF files, specifically in how augmentation data lengths are calculated and validated. When the `display_debug_frames` function in the `dwarf.c` file processes a crafted ELF file, it doesn't properly check for integer overflows. This can result in a heap-based buffer over-read. Such misuse of unchecked or improperly validated data lengths can lead to application crashes (denial of service) and possibly even unspecified impacts, which may include allowing attackers to execute arbitrary code or leak memory information.

From the provided patch details, we can see several crucial changes made to address this vulnerability:

1. The data type used to store the aforementioned length - `augmentation_data_len` - was changed from `unsigned long` to `bfd_size_type`, presumably to ensure it can properly represent the size of the data being processed across various platforms and configurations, mitigating the impact of potential integer overflow.

2. Introduction of bounds checking before processing augmentation data. The patch added checks to ensure that the `augmentation_data_len` does not exceed what would be reasonable comparing to the buffer's end (`end - start`). This helps prevent the buffer over-read by ensuring that the calculated length doesn't indicate a size beyond the actual memory allocated or available for the augmentation data.

3. Addition of a new function `display_augmentation_data`, which seems to centralize and perhaps sanitize how augmentation data is printed. While not directly addressing overflow, organizing such logic can help ensure consistent validation and display of data across the codebase, potentially making future maintenance or security updates more straightforward.

4. The patch also includes a precise and clearer warning message that alerts about corrupt augmentation data length, aiding in diagnostics and emphasizing the importance of this check.

By addressing these issues with appropriate data types for size representations, better boundary checks, and cleaner warning messages for potentially problematic situations, the patch aims to prevent attackers from exploiting the integer overflow vulnerability related to augmentation data processing in ELF files within GNU Binutils.
