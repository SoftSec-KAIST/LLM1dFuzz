The root cause of CVE-2017-16828 in GNU Binutils 2.29.1, as identified from the patch and description provided, is an integer overflow vulnerability occurring due to improper handling of augmentation data lengths in ELF files. Specifically, the issue arises in the handling of DWARF debugging information within ELF files by the `display_debug_frames` function in `dwarf.c`.

Here's a breakdown of how the root cause leads to the vulnerability:

1. **Improper Data Type for Length Variables**: The original code used an improper data type (`unsigned long`) that could not properly handle the sizes of the augmentation data segment, especially when dealing with large or corrupt ELF files. This could lead to integer overflow situations.

2. **Insufficient Validation of Augmentation Data Length**: The code did not adequately validate the length of the augmentation data read from an ELF file. If an ELF file contained corrupt or specifically crafted augmentation data, this lack of proper validation could lead to integer overflows.

3. **Potential Buffer Over-read**: Due to the integer overflow, the logic could miscalculate buffer sizes, leading to heap-based buffer over-reads. When attempting to access memory beyond the allocated heap buffer, this could result in a Denial of Service (DoS) by crashing the application or potentially lead to other unspecified impacts.

The patch addresses these issues by:

- **Changing Data Type**: Switching the data type for `augmentation_data_len` to `bfd_size_type`, which is more appropriate for handling sizes and reduces the risk of overflow.

- **Adding Validation and Overflow Checks**: The patched code introduces more thorough checks for integer overflow scenarios, particularly when calculating the length and size constraints of augmentation data segments. This includes safely checking if the `augmentation_data_len` exceeds the expected bounds or if the calculations would result in accessing memory outside the intended buffer.

- **Refactoring for Code Clarity and Safety**: Introducing a new function, `display_augmentation_data`, separates the logic for displaying the augmentation data and allows for safer handling and presentation of that data, including fitting the output into constraints like 80 columns or handling wide displays.

By addressing the type used for length variables and introducing better validation and bounds checking, the patch mitigates the risk of integer overflows and the consequential heap-based buffer over-read or application crashes when processing malformed ELF files. This effectively remedies the vulnerabilities described in CVE-2017-16828.
