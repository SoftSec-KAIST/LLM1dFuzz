The root cause of CVE-2017-16828 involves a couple of fundamental issues within the handling of ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) files by the `display_debug_frames` function in `dwarf.c` from GNU Binutils version 2.29.1, as described by the details of the vulnerability and the provided patch:

1. **Integer Overflow**: The initial problem stems from an integer overflow vulnerability. When Binutils processes ELF files, it reads data describing the debugging frames, which can include augmentation data of variable length. The variable `augmentation_data_len`, which stores the length of this data, was initially of type `unsigned long`. In the scenario of handling a crafted ELF file, an attacker could manipulate the file in such a manner that when Binutils reads the augmentation data length, it could result in an integer overflow. This issue arises because the size of the augmentation data is not properly checked against the maximum size that can be represented by an `unsigned long`, allowing values that exceed this bound to cause an overflow.

2. **Heap-Based Buffer Over-Read**: As a direct consequence of the integer overflow, the application could attempt to read beyond the bounds of allocated heap memory. This is because the incorrect augmentation data length (inflated due to overflow) could lead the application to believe more data is present in the buffer than actually is. When the program then tries to access this non-existent "extra" data, it results in a heap-based buffer over-read. This scenario compromises the stability of the application, leading to a Denial of Service (DoS) as the minimal impact by crashing the application. Depending on the nature of the overflow and the specifics of the memory layout, it might also open up avenues for other malicious impacts, though these are not specified in the CVE description.

The patch addresses these issues primarily by changing the data type of `augmentation_data_len` from `unsigned long` to `bfd_size_type`. This modification ensures that the size of the augmentation data is appropriately checked and handled, thereby preventing an integer overflow. Additionally, the patch introduces more robust checks against the length of the augmentation data, specifically validating against the case where the calculated length could lead to reading beyond the buffer or result in negative values (which would indicate an overflow scenario).

Furthermore, the introduction of the `display_augmentation_data` function as a unified method to safely handle and display augmentation data highlights an effort to centralize and standardize the handling of this potentially sensitive operation, reducing the likelihood of similar vulnerabilities in related code paths.

Overall, the root cause is a classic example of insufficient validation of external input (in this case, the size of a section of an ELF file), leading to dangerous behavior (integer overflow and buffer over-read), with the solution being a combination of improved data type choice and enhanced validation logic.
