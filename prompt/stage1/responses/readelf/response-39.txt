The root cause of CVE-2017-16828 in GNU Binutils 2.29.1 stems from improperly handling ELF files with corrupt augmentation data, which can result in an integer overflow and a heap-based buffer over-read when displaying debug frames. Specifically, the vulnerability is related to the handling of the length of augmentation data when processing ELF files using the `display_debug_frames` function in `dwarf.c`. 

The patch addresses this vulnerability by changing the data type of `augmentation_data_len` from `unsigned long` to `bfd_size_type`. This change is made within the functions `read_cie` and `display_debug_frames`. Additionally, the patch introduces a new function `display_augmentation_data` to encapsulate the handling and display of augmentation data, providing a more robust mechanism for handling the size and output of such data safely. The use of `bfd_size_type` helps to ensure that the size calculations are handled in a manner consistent with the bounds expected by the Binutils infrastructure, thus preventing overflow.

Moreover, checks for integer overflow are added when calculating or comparing `augmentation_data_len` against the buffer's bounds. Such checks help to ensure that scenarios where the augmentation data length could exceed the bounds of the allocated buffer or represent an unreasonable size are handled gracefully, triggering warnings rather than causing a crash or undefined behavior.

In summary, the root cause was insufficient validation and type usage for representing the length of augmentation data in ELF files, which could be exploited when processing specially crafted ELF files. The patch corrects these issues by adjusting data types and improving validation checks to handle corrupt or malicious input safely.
