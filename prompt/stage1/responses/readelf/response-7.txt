The root cause of CVE-2017-16828 in the GNU Binutils 2.29.1 relates to how the `display_debug_frames` function in `dwarf.c` handles the augmentation data in ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) files. Specifically, the vulnerability arises from an integer overflow that occurs when reading ELF binaries with corrupt augmentation data, leading to a heap-based buffer over-read and, as a result, a possible denial of service (DoS) or an application crash. In some cases, unspecified impacts could also occur, likely due to the potential for executing or influencing behavior with crafted bytes in the heap region.

The patch addresses this vulnerability by changing the data type used to store the `augmentation_data_len` from an `unsigned long` to a `bfd_size_type`. This change is critical because `bfd_size_type` is more appropriate for representing sizes and lengths in the context of the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library, which underpins Binutils' handling of different binary formats. The use of the correct data type here helps to properly manage the size of data being read, thus preventing the integer overflow.

Moreover, the patch includes additional checks to ensure that the `augmentation_data_len` is not larger than what is expected, based on the distance between the current position (`start`) and the end of the available data buffer (`end`). These checks are vital for ensuring that the program does not attempt to read beyond the buffer's limits, which would lead to the buffer over-read and potentially to memory corruption issues.

Also, the patch introduces the `display_augmentation_data` function to neatly encapsulate the logic for displaying augmentation data. This refactor not only makes the code more readable but also ensures that the handling of augmentation data is consistent and can benefit from the introduced length checks.

In summary, the root cause of CVE-2017-16828 is improper handling of corrupted augmentation data sizes in ELF binaries, leading to integer overflows and buffer over-reads. The applied patch fixes this by using an appropriate data type for sizes, adding checks to prevent overflows, and refactoring the code for better management of augmentation data display.
