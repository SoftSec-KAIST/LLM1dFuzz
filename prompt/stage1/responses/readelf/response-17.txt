The root cause of CVE-2017-16828 in GNU Binutils 2.29.1 pertains to an integer overflow issue encountered when processing crafted ELF files, specifically within the handling of augmentation data in DWARF debugging information.

Analyzing the patch provided for this vulnerability, we can deduce the following key points leading to the integer overflow and subsequent heap-based buffer over-read (and possibly other impacts):

1. **Use of Incorrect Data Type for Length**: Prior to the patch, the length of the augmentation data was stored in an `unsigned long` variable. However, in the context of ELF files which can be operated on different platforms, the use of this data type might not be appropriate or sufficiently large to handle all possible sizes of augmentation data safely. This mismatch in the expected and actual size of variables could lead to integer overflow situations.

2. **Lack of Proper Validation and Overflow Checks**: The original code did not adequately check for overflow conditions when reading the length of the augmentation data from the ELF file. Consequently, a crafted file with an exceptionally large value for the augmentation data length could result in an overflow when computing offsets or sizes, leading to memory corruption vulnerabilities such as buffer over-reads.

3. **Inadequate Size Comparisons and Error Handling**: There was insufficient comparison between the read augmentation data length and the actual available data size (remaining in the buffer). The code did not correctly handle situations where the augmentation data length was unreasonably large compared to the buffer size, potentially allowing attackers to exploit this discrepancy.

**Patch Analysis**:
- The patch addresses the root cause by changing the data type for `augmentation_data_len` from `unsigned long` to `bfd_size_type`, which is a more flexible and appropriate type for handling sizes in a portable and safe manner across different architectures.
- It introduces proper checks for integer overflow conditions, notably when determining if the augmented data length exceeds the bounds of the remaining buffer. This is achieved by comparing the `augmentation_data_len` with the computed size that considers the buffer's end and the current position, thus preventing reads beyond the allocated buffer.
- The patch also adds a new function `display_augmentation_data()` to standardize and safely display augmentation data while handling size considerations more effectively.

In summary, the root cause revolves around the mishandling of data sizes and lack of proper validation and checks when dealing with externally provided data lengths in ELF files, which could lead to integer overflow and memory corruption. The applied patch fixes these issues by using suitable data types, adding necessary checks, and enhancing the data handling strategy to prevent exploitation.
