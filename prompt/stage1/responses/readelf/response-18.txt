The root cause of CVE-2017-16828 appears to be an integer overflow issue within the GNU Binutils software, particularly in how it processes DWARF debugging information in ELF files. Specifically, the vulnerability exists in the `display_debug_frames` function in `dwarf.c` when handling augmented data lengths in ELF binary files.

Looking at the patch details, we can identify the core issue and the corrective measures taken:

1. **Integer Overflow in Augmentation Data Length Handling**: The original code used an `unsigned long` data type for the `augmentation_data_len` variable, which stores the length of augmentation data in a debugging information entry. If a crafted ELF file provided a very large value for this length, it could lead to an integer overflow. This overflow could then cause a heap-based buffer over-read, leading to a denial of service (application crash) or possibly other unspecified impacts.

2. **Use of `bfd_size_type` for `augmentation_data_len`**: In the patch, the data type of `augmentation_data_len` is changed to `bfd_size_type` from `unsigned long`. This change might imply that the new data type (`bfd_size_type`) is better suited for handling the sizes of file and memory objects in a portable and safe manner across different platforms, possibly offering a wider range of values to prevent overflow.

3. **Overflow Check During Length Test**: The patch adds checks to ensure that the calculated `augmentation_data_len` does not exceed the bounds of the remaining data buffer. This is important to prevent reading beyond the buffer, which could result in undefined behavior or access violation errors.

4. **Refactoring for Augmentation Data Display**: The patch introduces a new function `display_augmentation_data` to encapsulate the logic for printing augmentation data. While this change doesn't directly address the overflow issue, it contributes to cleaner code by separating concerns and making the display logic reusable. This also helps in ensuring that any future changes related to augmentation data display are localized to this function, potentially reducing the risk of reintroducing similar vulnerabilities.

In summary, the root cause of CVE-2017-16828 is an integer overflow vulnerability due to improper handling of augmentation data lengths in ELF files processed by GNU Binutils. The fix involves using a more appropriate data type for length variables, adding checks to prevent overflow, and refactoring code for better maintainability.
