The root cause of the CVE-2017-16828 in GNU Binutils 2.29.1 appears to originate from improper handling of augmentation data length in ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) files, leading to an integer overflow. This issue occurs within the processing of DWARF debugging information, specifically in the functions related to displaying debug frames (`display_debug_frames`) and reading the Common Information Entry (`CIE`) of a frame (`read_cie`).

The issue stems from the fact that the augmentation data length was initially handled as an `unsigned long` type, which could lead to an integer overflow when the function attempts to read augmentation data from a crafted ELF file. An attacker could exploit this overflow by providing a specially crafted ELF file with corrupt augmentation data length values, which then could lead to a heap-based buffer over-read, application crash (denial of service), or possibly other unspecified impacts.

The patch addresses this vulnerability by changing the data type used to store the augmentation data length from `unsigned long` to `bfd_size_type`. This change is meant to ensure that the data type can accommodate the size requirements and thus mitigate the risk of integer overflow. Additionally, the patch includes checks for integer overflow scenarios when handling augmentation data length, and it introduces a new function (`display_augmentation_data`) to safely print out the contents of the augmentation data array.

Moreover, the patch includes new validation checks to ensure the sanity of the augmentation data length before use, such as verifying that the calculated length does not exceed the buffer bounds and checking for negative values that could indicate corrupt data.

In summary, the root cause of CVE-2017-16828 was inadequate handling of augmentation data lengths, leading to potential integer overflows. This was addressed by changing the data type for augmentation data length to `bfd_size_type`, adding checks to prevent overflow, and improving the validation of the augmentation data length before its use.
