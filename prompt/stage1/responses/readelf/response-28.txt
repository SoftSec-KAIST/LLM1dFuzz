The root cause of CVE-2017-16828 in GNU Binutils 2.29.1, as indicated by the description and the fix provided in the patch, revolves around an integer overflow issue when handling ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) files, specifically related to processing augmentation data in debugging information.

The key points leading to this vulnerability can be highlighted as follows:

1. **Integer Overflow in Handling Augmentation Data Length**: The original implementation used a type (`unsigned long`) that may not be capable of representing the sizes of all memory objects in a portable manner, especially on platforms where `unsigned long` is a 32-bit type. This inadequacy led to an integer overflow condition when reading ELF files containing corrupt augmentation data with a length that exceeded the maximum representable by this type.

2. **Improper Validation of Augmentation Data Length**: The code before the patch lacks adequate validation checks for the length of augmentation data. It does not correctly ensure that the augmentation data length specified in the ELF file doesn't exceed the actual remaining data available for reading. Consequently, this could lead to a heap-based buffer over-read, where more data is attempted to be read than available, leading to application crashes or potentially allowing attackers to read sensitive information from the memory.

3. **Use of the Correct Data Type**: The patch addresses the integer overflow problem by changing the type used to store the length of augmentation data (`augmentation_data_len`) to `bfd_size_type`. This type is more appropriate for representing sizes of objects and is platform-independent, ensuring that the data length can be accurately represented without overflow.

4. **Enhanced Data Length Validation**: Alongside the type change, the patch adds proper checks to prevent reading beyond the available data. This includes checking that the calculated end of the augmentation data does not surpass the end of the section being processed and handling cases where the length is found to be corrupt more gracefully.

5. **Refactoring for Code Clarity and Safety**: The patch also introduces a new function, `display_augmentation_data`, to handle the presentation of augmentation data. This refactoring improves code clarity and modularity, and by centralizing the augmentation data handling, it further reduces the risk of similar vulnerabilities arising in related code paths.

In summary, the root cause of CVE-2017-16828 is an integer overflow vulnerability stemming from the improper handling and validation of augmentation data lengths in ELF files, which the patch resolves through type changes, additional validations, and code refactoring to prevent over-reads and application crashes.
