Based on the provided patch and description, the root cause of CVE-2017-16828 appears to be an integer overflow issue related to handling augmentation data length in ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) files. When Binutils' `display_debug_frames` function processes augmentation data in a DWARF section of an ELF file, it uses variables to store the length of augmentation data. Before the patch, the type chosen for this purpose (`unsigned long`) was not adequately handling very large or specially crafted lengths, which could lead to integer overflow. This overflow could, in turn, cause heap-based buffer over-reads and application crashes when the software attempted to access or process out-of-bounds memory areas based on the overflowed length value.

To address this vulnerability, the patch changes the data type of `augmentation_data_len` from `unsigned long` to `bfd_size_type` in the `read_cie` and associated functions. This change likely helps in ensuring that the size of the augmentation data is correctly handled, even when dealing with large numbers, thus preventing the integer overflow. Additionally, the patch adds checks for integer overflow when assessing `augmentation_data_len` and refactors related code to use a new function `display_augmentation_data` for better handling and display of augmentation data, likely making the code more robust and maintainable.

The mentioned checks for integer overflow and the change of data type directly address the root cause by ensuring that the system can correctly handle and verify the sizes of augmentation data sections in ELF files, preventing attackers from exploiting this overflow vulnerability to cause a denial of service or potentially execute arbitrary code.
