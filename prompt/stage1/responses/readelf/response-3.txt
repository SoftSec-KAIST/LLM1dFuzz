The root cause of CVE-2017-16828 in GNU Binutils 2.29.1 is an integer overflow vulnerability within the handling of augmentation data length in ELF files. Specifically, this vulnerability arises in the `dwarf.c` file's `display_debug_frames` function, which processes debugging information in ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) files.

This issue occurs when parsing and processing ELF files with crafted (maliciously constructed) augmentation data. The original code used an `unsigned long` data type for `augmentation_data_len`, which is susceptible to integer overflow. If an attacker provides an ELF file with specially crafted augmentation data that exploits this overflow, it could lead to a heap-based buffer over-read. This buffer over-read could, in turn, lead to a denial of service (application crash) or potentially allow the attacker to have an unspecified impact on the system where the utility is run.

In the patch, the vulnerability is addressed by changing the type of `augmentation_data_len` from `unsigned long` to `bfd_size_type`. This change improves the handling of the size of the augmentation data, making the code more robust against integer overflow attacks. Furthermore, the patch includes checks for integer overflow when testing `augmentation_data_len` and additional utility functions to safely display augmentation data.

Moreover, the patch introduces careful validation of the `augmentation_data_len` value to ensure it does not exceed the expected boundaries, thereby preventing the over-reading of memory. These added checks and type adjustments mitigate the risk associated with handling potentially large or maliciously crafted values, effectively resolving the vulnerability.
