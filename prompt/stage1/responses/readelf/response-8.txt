The root cause of CVE-2017-16828 in GNU Binutils 2.29.1, as indicated by the patch, appears to be an integer overflow vulnerability. Specifically, this vulnerability occurs in the handling of the `augmentation_data_len` field within the `display_debug_frames` function in `dwarf.c`, when processing augmentation data in ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) files.

In the vulnerable version, `augmentation_data_len` is of type `unsigned long`, and there was no adequate check to ensure that the size of the augmentation data specified within an ELF file did not exceed the actual remaining data size in the file. This lack of verification could lead to an integer overflow when manipulating or reading augmentation data. Such an overflow could, in turn, result in a heap-based buffer over-read and might allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted ELF file containing malformed or malicious augmentation data.

The patch addresses this issue by changing the type of `augmentation_data_len` to `bfd_size_type`, which is more appropriate for representing sizes in this context. Additionally, the patch introduces checks to validate that the `augmentation_data_len` does not exceed the bounds of the memory allocated or available, thus preventing the integer overflow and ensuring the buffer over-read does not occur. It introduces a new function `display_augmentation_data` to encapsulate the safe handling and display of augmentation data, further modularizing the code and centralizing the fix. The use of `bfd_size_type` and better bounds-checking collectively mitigate the risk of integer overflows and heap-based buffer over-reads, addressing the root cause of the CVE.
