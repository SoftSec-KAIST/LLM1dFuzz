The root cause of CVE-2017-16828 seems to be an integer overflow issue in the handling of augmentation data length in ELF files, specifically in the context of displaying debug frames. The problem occurs when `dwarf.c` in GNU Binutils 2.29.1 processes a crafted ELF file through the `display_debug_frames` function. 

The original implementation used an `unsigned long` data type for `augmentation_data_len` to store the length of augmentation data. However, when dealing with a corrupted ELF file that has specially crafted augmentation data, this implementation could lead to an integer overflow. This overflow, in turn, could cause a heap-based buffer over-read or even crash the application, depending on how the overflowing value is subsequently used. In scenarios of memory corruption vulnerabilities, it's also conceivable that this could be exploited for arbitrary code execution, though the description focuses on the overflow leading to denial of service and potential other impacts.

The patch addresses this issue by changing the data type of `augmentation_data_len` to a `bfd_size_type`, providing a more appropriate type that likely has a wider range to handle the file sizes Binutils might typically encounter. Additionally, the patch adds checks for integer overflow conditions, specifically guarding against cases where the augmentation data length could exceed the expected bounds (e.g., being larger than the difference between the end of the augmentation data and its start). 

By incorporating a dedicated function `display_augmentation_data` to encapsulate the logic of displaying this data and incorporating proper size checks, the patch not only fixes the vulnerability but also improves the code organization and reusability. This approach ensures more robust error handling and validation of input file structures, preventing attackers from exploiting improperly validated input like overly large or negative data lengths that could lead to buffer over-reads or application crashes.
