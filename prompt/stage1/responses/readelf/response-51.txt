The root cause of CVE-2017-16828 in GNU Binutils 2.29.1, according to the provided patch and description, lies in an integer overflow issue when handling augmentation data length in ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) files. Specifically, the vulnerability is found within the `display_debug_frames` function in `dwarf.c`, which improperly handles integer values, leading to potential heap-based buffer over-reads and application crashes when processing crafted ELF files.

In the original code, the augmentation data length was managed using a type that was susceptible to integer overflow. If a specially crafted ELF file contained augmentation data with a length that, when parsed, could exceed the maximum value representable by the original data type, it would cause an overflow. This could lead to incorrect computations of buffer sizes or array indexes, resulting in unauthorized access to heap memory regions, potentially causing a denial of service (DoS) or even enabling unspecified impacts, which might include arbitrary code execution if exploitable under certain conditions.

The patch addresses this issue by:

1. Changing the data type used to store the augmentation data length from an `unsigned long` to a `bfd_size_type`. This change aims to handle larger sizes more accurately and reduce the risk of overflow.

2. Adding a new function, `display_augmentation_data`, which is responsible for safely printing the augmentation data. This function likely includes measures to correctly handle the size of the data and mitigate the risk of accessing memory out of bounds.

3. Incorporating checks for integer overflow when handling the augmentation data length. The code now includes checks to ensure that the augmentation data length does not exceed the expected bounds before proceeding with memory accesses based on this length.

4. Using the `dwarf_vmatoa` function for safer conversions and representations of data values in warning messages, helping to prevent misinterpretation or mishandling of data lengths.

In summary, the root cause of the vulnerability was the incorrect handling of augmentation data lengths in the processing of ELF files, leading to potential integer overflow and memory access issues. The patch fixes these issues by using appropriate data types, adding safety checks, and improving the handling and representation of critical data.
