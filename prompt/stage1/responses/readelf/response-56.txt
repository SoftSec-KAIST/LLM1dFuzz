The root cause of the vulnerability CVE-2017-16828 in GNU Binutils 2.29.1, as described, centers around an integer overflow issue in the handling of ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) files, specifically within the functions dealing with DWARF debugging information. This vulnerability arises when processing the augmentation data length in DWARF debugging frames.

The original code used an inappropriate data type (`unsigned long`), which did not properly account for the potential range of data sizes that could be encountered. When a crafted ELF file with corrupt augmentation data is processed, the insufficient size of this data type could lead to an integer overflow. This overflow, in turn, causes a heap-based buffer over-read scenario, where the application attempts to read beyond the allocated buffer. In the best-case scenario, this results in a denial of service (application crash) due to the application attempting to access memory out of the bounds of the buffer. In the worst-case scenario, it might allow attackers to have an unspecified impact on the application, potentially leading to code execution or information disclosure, depending on the memory layout and other factors at the time of the exploit.

The patch addresses this issue by changing the data type used for the `augmentation_data_len` from `unsigned long` to `bfd_size_type`. This change ensures that the data type used for the augmentation data length is capable of handling the sizes it needs to process safely, thereby mitigating the risk of integer overflow.

Additionally, the patch introduces a new function `display_augmentation_data` to encapsulate the logic for displaying the augmentation data and to perform safe checks on `augmentation_data_len` before using it. This helps to ensure that similar overflow issues do not occur elsewhere in the code and improves the readability and maintainability of the codebase by centralizing this logic.

In summary, the root cause of CVE-2017-16828 was an integer overflow vulnerability due to the use of a data type (`unsigned long`) that was unsuitable for the range of data sizes it needed to handle (augmentation data length in DWARF debugging frames). The fix involved switching to an appropriately sized data type (`bfd_size_type`) and refactoring related code to improve safety and maintainability.
