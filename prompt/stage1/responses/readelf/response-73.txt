The root cause of CVE-2017-16828 in GNU Binutils 2.29.1, as cited within the given information and patch details, can be attributed to an integer overflow vulnerability occurring due to improper handling of augmentation data length when reading a corrupt ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) binary. Specifically, the issue arises in the handling of augmentation data length in `dwarf.c`, part of the debugger and binary utilities package.

The vulnerability is primarily due to the incorrect data type `unsigned long` used to store augmentation data lengths. This inappropriate choice can lead to an integer overflow when the program encounters ELF files with specially crafted or corrupt augmentation data. This overflow can, in turn, cause a heap-based buffer over-read, leading to a denial of service (DoS) through application crashes or potentially other unspecified impacts, which could include execution of arbitrary code or information disclosure, depending on the nature of the overflow and the subsequent memory corruption.

The patch addresses this issue by:

1. **Changing the Data Type:** Replacing the `unsigned long` data type with `bfd_size_type` for storing augmentation data lengths. `bfd_size_type` is more appropriate for handling sizes of file contents and is less prone to overflows on platforms where its size exceeds that of `unsigned long`. This change is pertinent as it ensures that the data type used for lengths can accommodate large values without overflowing, matching the data type expected by functions interacting with binary file data.

2. **Adding Overflow Checks:** Implementing checks to confirm that the augmentation data length does not exceed the expected bounds (i.e., the size of the remaining data to read). This is crucial for preventing overflows by ensuring that any attempt to read beyond the available data triggers a warning and the operation is stopped, mitigating the risk of reading invalid memory.

3. **Refactoring for Clarity and Security:** Introducing `display_augmentation_data()`, a new function for printing augmentation data. This contributes to cleaner code and makes it easier to handle augmentation data securely by centralizing its processing.

Overall, the patch mitigates the vulnerability by addressing the root cause—improper handling of sizes leading to integer overflow—and by adding safeguards to prevent similar issues from arising in the future through data type adjustments and additional validity checks.
