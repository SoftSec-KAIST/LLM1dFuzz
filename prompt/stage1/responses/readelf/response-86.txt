The root cause of CVE-2017-16828 in GNU Binutils 2.29.1, specifically within the `display_debug_frames` function in `dwarf.c`, appears to be an integer overflow vulnerability. This vulnerability is triggered by processing crafted ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) files.

An integer overflow can occur when the program incorrectly handles arithmetic operations, leading to a result that is too large to be stored in the allocated data type. In this context, the issue arises from handling augmentation data length values when reading and processing ELF files' debugging information. If attackers supply an ELF file with specially crafted augmentation data length values, it can lead to an overflow. This overflow, in turn, can cause a heap-based buffer over-read. Such a buffer over-read could allow attackers to either crash the application, leading to a denial of service, or potentially execute arbitrary code or cause other unspecified impacts.

The patch addresses the vulnerability by:

1. Changing the type of `augmentation_data_len` from `unsigned long` to `bfd_size_type`. This change is meant to ensure that the data type used for `augmentation_data_len` is wide enough to handle large values without overflowing.

2. Introducing checks for integer overflow when testing `augmentation_data_len` against the boundary conditions. Specifically, it adds safeguards to ensure that the calculated length does not exceed the available data space, which would indicate an overflow condition.

3. Implementing a new function, `display_augmentation_data`, which encapsulates the logic for safely displaying augmentation data. This function likely includes protections or safeguards against potentially dangerous operations resulting from overflowed length values.

In summary, the root cause of CVE-2017-16828 is an integer overflow vulnerability regarding the handling of augmentation data length values in ELF files' debugging information. The provided patch fixes this by using appropriate data types and adding checks to prevent overflows, thereby ensuring the safety of memory operations and preventing malicious exploitation.
