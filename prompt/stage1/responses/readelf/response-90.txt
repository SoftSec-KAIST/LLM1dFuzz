The root cause of CVE-2017-16828 in GNU Binutils 2.29.1 was primarily an integer overflow issue that occurred while handling a crafted ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) file. Specifically, the vulnerability was present in the display_debug_frames function in dwarf.c, which is part of the software used to process debugging information.

The problem stemmed from how the software calculated the length of augmentation data for a "Common Information Entry" (CIE) or a "Frame Description Entry" (FDE) in a DWARF debugging information section of an ELF file. If an attacker crafted an ELF file with corrupt augmentation data that specified a very large length, it could lead to an integer overflow. This overflow, in turn, affected the logic that determined how much memory should be read, potentially causing a heap-based buffer over-read or even an application crash when trying to access memory out of bounds. Additionally, the unchecked length value could potentially lead to other unspecified impacts, which might include code execution under certain circumstances, although the CVE entry does not explicitly mention this possibility.

The patch addresses this vulnerability by changing the type used to represent the augmentation_data_len from an unsigned long to a bfd_size_type, which is a type safely capable of representing sizes and offsets within binary files being processed. Furthermore, the patch adds checks to ensure that the calculated length of the augmentation data does not cause an integer overflow and does not exceed the expected bounds. It also introduces a new function, display_augmentation_data, to safely display the augmentation data, factoring in the new, more robust handling of the data length.

In summary, the root cause was insufficient validation of input data (specifically, lengths of sections within ELF files), leading to integer overflow and buffer over-read vulnerabilities. The fix ensures proper validation and safe handling of the lengths of data sections, mitigating the risk of denial of service or other potentially more severe impacts.
