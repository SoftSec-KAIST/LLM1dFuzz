The root cause of CVE-2017-16828 in the GNU Binutils 2.29.1 is an integer overflow vulnerability stemming from improper handling of augmentation data lengths within ELF files. Specifically, the vulnerability is located in the `display_debug_frames` function in `dwarf.c`. When Binutils processes corrupt or carefully crafted ELF files, the augmentation data length can exceed the bounds of what's considered valid, leading to an integer overflow. This overflow, in turn, can lead to a heap-based buffer over-read and an application crash, among other possible impacts like potential code execution or information disclosure based on the context and the specific manipulations made by an attacker.

From the provided patch information, the root cause was addressed by changing the data type of the `augmentation_data_len` variable from an unsigned long to a `bfd_size_type`, which is likely a larger type or more appropriately sized type, and by adding checks to prevent integer overflow when handling augmentation data lengths. The addition of the `display_augmentation_data` function helps manage and safely display the augmentation data in a controlled fashion. Also, corrections include checking for integer overflow (`augmentation_data_len > (bfd_size_type) (end - start))` and ensuring that the length does not result in reading beyond the expected data segment of the ELF file (`augmentation_data > start`). 

These changes mitigate the risk of processing maliciously crafted augmentation data lengths and ensure the integrity of the application's memory, preventing crashes and potentially more severe exploits stemming from the integer overflow.
