The root cause of CVE-2017-16828 in GNU Binutils involves an integer overflow that occurs when processing malformed augmentation data within an ELF file's debug frame information. Specifically, the vulnerability arises due to the handling of the length of augmentation data in the `dwarf.c` file, responsible for parsing DWARF debug information. 

Initially, the type used to represent the length of augmentation data (`augmentation_data_len`) was an unsigned long, which is prone to integer overflow if the ELF file contains corrupt or intentionally malicious augmentation data. This overflow could lead to incorrect memory operations, such as heap-based buffer over-reads, because the application might compute a buffer size that is too small for the actual data. Such incorrect memory handling can lead to crashes (denial-of-service conditions) or potentially enable other malicious impacts if an attacker can control the memory layout sufficiently to exploit the over-read data.

The patch addresses the vulnerability by changing the data type of `augmentation_data_len` from `unsigned long` to `bfd_size_type`. This adjustment is more robust against integer overflow by ensuring that the size type used is appropriate for the data being processed. The patch also includes checks for integer overflow when testing `augmentation_data_len` against the remaining buffer size (`end - start`). If the length is too large, suggesting overflow or other corruption, the function now emits a warning and gracefully handles the situation rather than potentially crashing. Additional code modifications improve the clarity and safety of augmentation data processing, such as the introduction of `display_augmentation_data` function to encapsulate augmentation data display logic, which helps to simplify and standardize the handling of such data.

In summary, the core issue was improper handling of user-supplied lengths for augmentation data in ELF files, which could be exploited through integer overflow to cause memory mismanagement. The patch rectifies this by using an appropriate data type for the length and by adding checks and safe handling for cases where the data may be corrupt or maliciously crafted.
