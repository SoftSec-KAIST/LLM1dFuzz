The root cause of CVE-2017-16828 in GNU Binutils 2.29.1 was an integer overflow vulnerability related to the processing of augmentation data within the `display_debug_frames` function in `dwarf.c`. This issue occurred when reading augmentation data length from a crafted ELF file, potentially leading to a heap-based buffer over-read and, consequently, an application crash. In a more malicious scenario, it could have allowed attackers to have an unspecified impact on the system processing the ELF file.

The vulnerability was specifically due to the use of an inappropriate data type for representing the length of the augmentation data (`augmentation_data_len`). Originally, it used an `unsigned long` type for this purpose. However, this choice made the code vulnerable to integer overflow when the ELF file contained corrupt or maliciously crafted augmentation data. The overflow could cause the application to read beyond the intended buffer when interpreting the augmentation data, leading to the mentioned denial of service (DoS) or other impacts.

The patch addresses this issue by changing the data type of `augmentation_data_len` from `unsigned long` to `bfd_size_type`. This change is crucial because `bfd_size_type` is designed to safely handle sizes of objects in binary files processed by Binutils, with considerations for platform-specific size constraints and safety checks against overflows. Additionally, the patch introduces checks for integer overflow conditions and refactors the code to include a new function `display_augmentation_data`, centralizing the logic for displaying augmentation data and thereby sanitizing the input more effectively. This not only fixes the immediate integer overflow problem but also improves the maintainability and readability of the code by isolating the functionality related to augmentation data display.

Thus, the root cause of the vulnerability was a combination of an inappropriate choice of data type for handling augmentation data lengths and the lack of sufficient input validation and overflow checks when reading and processing this data from an ELF file. The applied patch addresses these issues by correcting the data type mismatch and enhancing input validation, mitigating the risk of overflow and its potential impacts.
