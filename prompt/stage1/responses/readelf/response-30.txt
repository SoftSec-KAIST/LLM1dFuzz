The root cause of the CVE-2017-16828 vulnerability in GNU Binutils 2.29.1, specifically within the handling of ELF files by the `display_debug_frames` function in `dwarf.c`, is an integer overflow issue. This problem can lead to a heap-based buffer over-read and application crash, and potentially allow for further unspecified impacts when processing a crafted ELF file.

The vulnerability is related to how augmentation data length is handled during the display or parsing of debug frame information. Previously, the code used an `unsigned long` type for `augmentation_data_len`, which could lead to situations where the handling of overly large or malformed lengths result in integer overflow. This, combined with insufficient validation, could then result in buffer over-reads when the software attempts to process or display the augmentation data.

The patch addresses these concerns by:

1. **Changing Data Type**: It switches the variable `augmentation_data_len` from an `unsigned long` to `bfd_size_type`, which may offer a more suitable range or handling characteristics for the data being processed, aligning it with the actual size capabilities and improving type consistency.

2. **Adding Checks for Integer Overflow**: By adding explicit checks for integer overflow situations (e.g., verifying that `augmentation_data_len` does not exceed the remaining size of the buffer being read), the patch significantly reduces the risk of overstepping buffer bounds.

3. **New Function for Displaying Data**: Introduction of the `display_augmentation_data` function, which encapsulates the logic for outputting the augmentation data in a safer and more structured manner. This not only contributes to making the code more modular and readable but also allows for centralized handling of potential issues related to the display of augmentation data.

4. **Improved Validation**: By adding better checks and validation surrounding the length of the augmentation data (including scenarios where the calculated starting point of augmentation data could end up being beyond the actual data buffer limit due to corrupted length values), the patch aims to prevent situations where invalid data can cause crashes or undesired behavior.

In summary, the root cause of CVE-2017-16828 is an integer overflow vulnerability arising from improper handling and insufficient validation of augmentation data lengths in ELF files. The provided patch fixes the issue by improving data type choices, adding necessary overflow checks and validations, and tidying up the code structure for handling augmentation data display.
