The root cause of CVE-2017-16828 in GNU Binutils 2.29.1, as described, is an integer overflow vulnerability within the handling of augmentation data when reading a crafted ELF file, especially in the `display_debug_frames` function located in `dwarf.c`. This integer overflow could lead to a heap-based buffer over-read and potentially an application crash or other unspecified impacts.

From the patch provided, we can derive more details on the root cause and the approach to rectification:

1. **Data Type Selection for Size Variables:** The patch changes the data type of `augmentation_data_len` from `unsigned long` to `bfd_size_type`. This change is likely made to ensure that the data type used to represent sizes can safely accommodate the full range of possible values without overflow, which aligns better with the architecture-specific sizes of objects, particularly for applications dealing with file formats like ELF that may vary significantly in size.

2. **Overflow Check Enhancement:** The patch introduces checks for integer overflow conditions explicitly when dealing with augmentation data length. In the original code, if the augmentation data length was excessively large, it could result in reads beyond the intended buffer, leading to a denial of service or other exploitations. By adding checks to ensure that `augmentation_data_len` does not exceed the expected limits (essentially, the boundaries of the data being processed), the patched code prevents this scenario.

3. **Refined Error Handling:** With the introduction of the `display_augmentation_data` function and enhanced checks, the patch aims to improve the robustness of error handling. If augmentation data length is found to be incorrect (either too long or causing an overflow), warnings are issued with more precise formatting, and the function safely handles these cases to prevent crashes.

In summary, the root cause of CVE-2017-16828 is an integer overflow resulting from improper handling and insufficient validation of the augmentation data length read from an ELF file. The patch addresses this by adjusting the data types used for lengths, enhancing validation and checks for overflow conditions, and refining error messages and handling to maintain stability even when encountering malformed input.
