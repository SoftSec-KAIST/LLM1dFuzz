The root cause of CVE-2017-16828 in the GNU Binutils 2.29.1 `display_debug_frames` function seems to stem from an integer overflow issue and a heap-based buffer over-read due to improperly handling augmentation data length in ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) files. Specifically, the issue seems to be related to handling of corrupt ELF binaries that contain augmentation data with lengths that can lead to integer overflows. This could occur because the length of the augmentation data was being stored and manipulated as an `unsigned long`, which might not properly handle large or negative values that result from corrupted data, potentially leading to overflows when performing arithmetic operations or incorrect memory accesses.

The patch addresses this issue by changing the data type used to store the augmentation data length from `unsigned long` to `bfd_size_type`, which is a data type that is specifically designed to handle sizes of objects in BFD (Binary File Descriptor library) and could more appropriately represent the size of data being handled. This helps to prevent the integer overflow by using an appropriately sized data type.

Additionally, the patch includes checks for integer overflow when testing the augmentation data length and refactors the code to properly handle and display augmentation data, making the handling of ELF files more robust against corrupted data.

Furthermore, the introduction of the `display_augmentation_data` function contributes to a cleaner code structure by abstracting the logic for displaying augmentation data into a separate function, enhancing readability and maintainability, besides accommodating the new check for integer overflow and proper handling of augmentation data length. This not only helps mitigate the denial of service (DoS) risk but also reduces the chance of other potential impacts that could arise from mishandling malformed ELF files.
