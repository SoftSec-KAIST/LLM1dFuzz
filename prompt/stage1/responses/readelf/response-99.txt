The root cause of CVE-2017-16828 in the GNU Binutils 2.29.1 pertains to an integer overflow vulnerability within its handling of ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) files. This vulnerability arises due to improper management of augmentation data lengths within the `display_debug_frames` function in `dwarf.c`.

The issue is specifically tied to the handling of the `augmentation_data_len` variable, where an integer overflow could occur due to the variable being of type `unsigned long` instead of `bfd_size_type`, which is more suitable for safely handling size calculations across different platform architectures.

The overflow vulnerability occurs when reading an ELF file with corrupted augmentation data, potentially leading to a heap-based buffer over-read. An attacker could exploit this by crafting a malicious ELF file designed to trigger the overflow, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS) by crashing the application or potentially leading to other unspecified impacts.

The patch addresses this vulnerability by:

1. Changing the type of `augmentation_data_len` from `unsigned long` to `bfd_size_type` in both the `read_cie` and relevant call sites. This type is more robust against integer overflow as it aligns with the platform's addressable memory size, reducing the risk of overflows when handling large values.

2. Introducing bounds checks for `augmentation_data_len` to ensure that the length does not exceed the expected limits. This is crucial for preventing over-read scenarios.

3. Adding a new function `display_augmentation_data` to unify and safe-guard the display of augmentation data across the affected code paths. This function includes proper bounds checking and formatting to prevent misuse of the potentially corrupted `augmentation_data_len`.

In summary, the root cause revolves around insufficient validation and incorrect data type usage for handling lengths of augmentation data within ELF files, leading to an integer overflow vulnerability. The fix involves proper type usage, bounds checking, and systematic display logic to prevent exploitation.
