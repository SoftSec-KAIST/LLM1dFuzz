The root cause of CVE-2017-16828 in GNU Binutils 2.29.1, as described in the patch and commit, appears to be an integer overflow vulnerability that occurs when handling augmentation data length in the ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) file's debugging information, specifically in the processing of DWARF debug data.

From the patch details, two primary corrections were made:

1. **Data Type Change**: The data type for `augmentation_data_len` was changed from `unsigned long` to `bfd_size_type`. This change suggests the original data type might not have been capable of properly handling the sizes of all possible inputs, particularly for larger ELF files or those with corrupt/malicious augmentation data. `bfd_size_type` is presumably a more suitable type that can accurately represent the size of data being read, helping to prevent integer overflows.

2. **Integer Overflow Check**: The patched code introduces a check for integer overflow conditions when determining the `augmentation_data_len`. This check aims to ensure that the calculated length of the augmentation data does not exceed the actual space available (`end - start`), which would indicate an overflow and potentially corrupt or malicious data. This validation step is crucial for preventing scenarios where overly large values could lead to buffer over-read vulnerabilities, as mentioned in the CVE description.

The description of CVE-2017-16828 mentions that an attacker can cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly have an unspecified impact via a crafted ELF file. This could happen if an ELF file with specially crafted (corrupt or deliberately malformed) augmentation data caused an miscalculation of the `augmentation_data_len`, leading to an integer overflow. Without proper validation and handling of this length, operations that read from the heap based on this calculated length could read beyond the buffer's end (buffer over-read), resulting in application crashes or potentially exploiting the vulnerability for more malicious purposes.

The patch addresses this root cause by ensuring the length calculation is properly checked against overflow conditions and by using a data type for lengths that is more resilient to overflow. This combined approach significantly mitigates the risk of processing malformed or malicious ELF files that seek to exploit this vulnerability.
