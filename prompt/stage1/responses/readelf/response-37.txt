The root cause of CVE-2017-16828 appears to be related to an integer overflow vulnerability when processing augmentation data in ELF binaries. This issue stems from reading and handling augmentation data length within the GNU Binutils tool, specifically within the handling of debug frames in dwarf.c.

Looking closely at the description and the patch provided:

1. **Integer Overflow**: The function `read_cie` and other related functions initially used an `unsigned long` type for `augmentation_data_len`, which stores the length of the augmentation data in an ELF binary's debugging information. An attacker could craft a malicious ELF file with a specific augmentation data length that triggers an integer overflow. This overflow could subsequently lead to a heap-based buffer over-read, leading to a denial of service (application crash) and potentially allowing the attacker to have an unspecified impact on the application.

2. **Patch Analysis**:
   - The patch addresses this vulnerability by changing the type of `augmentation_data_len` from `unsigned long` to `bfd_size_type`. The `bfd_size_type` is presumably a type that can safely contain the size of objects in memory, including checking for overflows.
   - Fixes involve adding checks for integer overflow when computing the size and processing the augmentation data. It ensures that the length of augmentation data does not exceed the expected bounds and is not susceptible to integer overflow, which could corrupt memory accesses.
   - The patch introduces a new function `display_augmentation_data`, which is designed to safely print the augmentation data. This suggests an improvement in handling binary data in a way that minimizes risks of buffer over-reads or other memory corruption issues.
   
3. **Root Cause Summary**: The root of the vulnerability is inadequate type and bounds checking when reading and handling augmentation data lengths in ELF files. This inadequacy made it possible for crafted files to cause integer overflows, leading to unsafe memory operations. The fix involved switching to a more appropriate data type and adding explicit checks against overflow, aiming to ensure that memory operations remain safe and within expected bounds.

Understanding vulnerabilities like CVE-2017-16828 provides insight into the importance of proper data type selection, thorough input validation, and secure coding practices in software development, especially in tools that process complex file formats like ELF binaries.
