The root cause of CVE-2017-3735 is due to an out-of-bounds (OOB) read issue while parsing an IPAddressFamily extension in an X.509 certificate. Specifically, when the code attempts to retrieve the Address Family Identifier (AFI) from the `addressFamily` data within an `IPAddressFamily` structure, it doesn't properly ensure that there is enough data available before reading two bytes to form the AFI. This results in a scenario where, if the `addressFamily->data` is less than two bytes, accessing `data[1]` goes beyond the allocated buffer, leading to a one-byte overread.

The vulnerability stems from not validating that the `addressFamily` buffer contains the minimum required length (2 bytes in this case) to safely perform the operations that follow. The assumption that `addressFamily->data` is at least two bytes long without verification is what leads to the vulnerability. Accessing memory beyond the allocated buffer can result in unpredictable behavior depending on what data happens to reside in the memory adjacent to the buffer. While the immediate impact, as described, is an incorrect text display of the certificate due to misinterpretation of the out-of-bounds byte read, the implications of such memory safety violations can potentially be more severe, depending on the context and specific memory layout at the time of exploitation.

The patch addresses this issue by adding a check to ensure that `f->addressFamily->length` is at least 2 bytes before proceeding to extract the AFI using bitwise operations on the first two bytes of the `addressFamily->data`. This effectively prevents the out-of-bounds read by ensuring that there's sufficient data to read from, thus mitigating the vulnerability. This is a classic example of the importance of validating all inputs and ensuring buffer lengths are checked before performing operations on them, especially in security-sensitive contexts such as parsing X.509 certificates.
