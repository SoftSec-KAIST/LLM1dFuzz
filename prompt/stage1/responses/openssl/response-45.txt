The root cause of CVE-2017-3735 in OpenSSL was an instance of a one-byte overread error that occurred while parsing the IPAddressFamily extension in an X.509 certificate. The bug was present in the function `X509v3_addr_get_afi` within the code. Specifically, the error occurred because the function did not properly check that the `addressFamily` field of the `IPAddressFamily` structure pointed to a sufficiently large buffer before attempting to access its contents. This absence of a proper length check could lead to an attempt to read beyond the allocated buffer when accessing the `addressFamily->data` array. 

In the original code snippet before the patch, the function attempted to construct an unsigned int value by accessing the first two bytes of the `addressFamily->data` array without verifying that this array contained at least two bytes. This oversight allowed for a situation where, if the `addressFamily->data` contained less than two bytes, accessing the second byte (`addressFamily->data[1]`) would result in a one-byte overread, potentially accessing memory adjacent to the intended buffer. Such a mistake typically leads to undefined behavior, including incorrect data being read and used in the program, crashes, or security vulnerabilities due to potential information leakage.

The patch addresses this root cause by introducing a conditional check to ensure that the `addressFamily` field is not null, its `data` member is also not null, and critically, that the length of the data is at least two bytes (`f->addressFamily->length < 2`) before proceeding to access the `data` array. By adding this check, the patch effectively prevents the code from attempting to read beyond the allocated memory space, thus averting the one-byte overread vulnerability.

This vulnerability highlights the importance of rigorously checking buffer lengths before accessing buffers, especially in security-critical software like OpenSSL that deals with parsing and interpreting externally provided data such as X.509 certificates. Properly validating the size of buffers before use is a foundational practice in secure software development to prevent buffer over-reads and buffer overflows, both of which can lead to security vulnerabilities.
