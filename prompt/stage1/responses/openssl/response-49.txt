The root cause of CVE-2017-3735 is a one-byte overread vulnerability in the OpenSSL library when the code parses the IPAddressFamily extension of an X.509 certificate. This vulnerability is caused by assuming that the `addressFamily` field within an `IPAddressFamily` structure always contains sufficient data (at least two bytes) to read without validating that assumption. The faulty code proceeds to read the two bytes needed to represent the address family identifier without first checking if at least two bytes are available. This can lead to reading data that is out of bounds of the `addressFamily->data` buffer, depending on the actual length of the `addressFamily->data`.

Before the patch, the code assumed the existence and correctness of the `f->addressFamily->data` by checking for null pointers but did not verify the length of the data array before accessing its elements. Thus, when attempting to combine these bytes to form the address family identifier, it may read beyond the allocated memory if the length is less than two bytes.

The patch fixes the issue by explicitly checking if the `addressFamily->length` is less than 2 bytes, along with the previous null pointer checks. If any of these conditions are not met, the function now safely returns 0, avoiding the out-of-bounds read. This change ensures that the code does not attempt to access data outside the bounds of the `addressFamily->data` buffer, addressing the vulnerability by preventing the incorrect text display of the certificate caused by the one-byte overread. 

In summary, the root cause was the lack of sufficient checks on the size of the `addressFamily->data` array before accessing its contents, leading to a potential out-of-bounds read. The patch mitigates this by adding a length check, ensuring that there are at least two bytes available in the `addressFamily->data` buffer before proceeding with the read operation.
