The root cause of CVE-2017-3735 is an out-of-bounds read error occurring while parsing the IPAddressFamily extension in an X.509 certificate. Specifically, this vulnerability arises because the original code did not properly check the length of the `addressFamily` data before accessing it. The code assumed that the data field was long enough to contain at least two bytes (since it directly accessed `data[0]` and `data[1]` for constructing the return value). However, if the `addressFamily` data was shorter than two bytes or not properly initialized, accessing `data[1]` could read beyond the allocated memory for `addressFamily->data`, leading to a one-byte overread.

This kind of vulnerability can potentially lead to undefined behavior, including crashes or incorrect processing of certificate information. In this specific case, it resulted in improper text display of the certificate. Such memory safety issues are frequent root causes of security vulnerabilities in software written in languages like C, which do not inherently enforce memory bounds checks.

The provided patch fixes the vulnerability by adding a precondition check to ensure that `f->addressFamily` is not NULL, `f->addressFamily->data` is not NULL, and most importantly, that `f->addressFamily->length` is at least 2 bytes long before attempting to read the two bytes specified. This change prevents the potential out-of-bounds read by validating the assumptions about the data structure's integrity and length before accessing its elements.
