The root cause of CVE-2017-3735 lies in an insufficient validation of input data when parsing the IPAddressFamily extension in an X.509 certificate, specifically leading to a one-byte overread. This vulnerability results from the code assuming that the `addressFamily` data of the `IPAddressFamily` structure has a certain minimum length (at least 2 bytes required to read a two-byte Address Family Identifier (AFI)) without properly verifying this assumption. 

Before the patch, the code did not check if the `addressFamily->length` was less than the expected size (2 bytes in this case), meaning that if `addressFamily->data` was shorter than 2 bytes, the expression `((f->addressFamily->data[0] << 8) | (f->addressFamily->data[1]))` could attempt to read beyond the allocated memory for `addressFamily->data`. This out-of-bounds read could lead to undefined behavior including incorrect display of certificate information or potentially other impacts depending on how the corrupted data is subsequently used or interpreted by the application.

The provided patch addresses this root cause by adding a condition to check if `f->addressFamily->length` is less than 2, thereby ensuring that there's sufficient data to safely perform the bitwise operations without risking an out-of-bounds read. If the condition for safe length is not met, it returns 0, effectively preventing the vulnerability from being exploited. This fix enhances the robustness of the input validation process and ensures that only well-structured `IPAddressFamily` data is processed.
