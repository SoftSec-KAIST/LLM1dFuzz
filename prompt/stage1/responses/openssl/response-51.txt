The root cause of CVE-2017-3735 is an issue of a one-byte overread in the OpenSSL code when parsing the IPAddressFamily extension in an X.509 certificate. This happens due to the lack of proper validation before accessing the `addressFamily` data. Specifically, the original code did not check if the `addressFamily` field contained enough data before attempting to read two bytes from it (`data[0]` and `data[1]`). This could lead to reading beyond the allocated memory if `addressFamily->length` is less than 2 bytes, causing incorrect text display of the certificate and potentially leading to a crash or other undesirable behavior due to processing unexpected data.

The patch fixes this vulnerability by adding a check for `f->addressFamily->length < 2` before proceeding to read the two bytes. This ensures that there is enough data to safely perform the operation, effectively preventing the out-of-bounds read. The previous logic assumed the presence and adequacy of data without verification, which constituted the root cause of the security flaw.
