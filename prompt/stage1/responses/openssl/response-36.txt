The root cause of CVE-2017-3735 in OpenSSL involves a one-byte overread issue that occurs while parsing an IPAddressFamily extension in an X.509 certificate. This vulnerability stems from improper validation of the length of the addressFamily field before accessing its data. In the original code, there was an assumption that the `addressFamily` field and its `data` subfield were not NULL and contained valid data. This assumption led to directly accessing the data with an index without checking if the data length was sufficient, potentially leading to reading beyond the allocated memory.

The patch corrects this behavior by adding a check to ensure that the `addressFamily` is not NULL, its `data` field is also not NULL, and crucially, that the length of the `addressFamily` is at least 2 bytes long before attempting to read the two bytes necessary to construct the return value. By performing these checks before accessing the data, the patched code avoids the possibility of an out-of-bounds read, which could lead to incorrect text display of the certificate or potentially other, more severe impacts depending on how the out-of-bounds data is used by the application.

Therefore, the essence of the root cause is the lack of sufficient input validation (specifically, length validation) before accessing memory, which is a common source of vulnerabilities in software dealing with externally provided data. This issue underscores the importance of rigorously checking the validity of all inputs, especially those that come from outside the application, such as data within certificates in cryptographic software like OpenSSL.
