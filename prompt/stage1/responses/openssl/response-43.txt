The root cause of CVE-2017-3735 appears to be related to insufficient validation of input data when parsing the IPAddressFamily extension in an X.509 certificate. Specifically, the vulnerability lies in the handling of data that does not ensure that the `addressFamily` field of an `IPAddressFamily` structure contains enough data before accessing it. 

In the original code, there were checks to ensure that `f` (the `IPAddressFamily`), `f->addressFamily`, and `f->addressFamily->data` were not NULL, but there was no check to ensure that the `addressFamily`'s `data` field contained at least 2 bytes of data before attempting to access `data[0]` and `data[1]`. This oversight could result in an attempt to read data beyond the allocated memory boundary (a one-byte overread) if the data was exactly one byte long. Such out-of-bounds reads are a common source of security vulnerabilities because they can lead to incorrect program behavior, including crashes or information leaks.

The patch addresses this vulnerability by adding a check to ensure that `f->addressFamily->length` is at least 2 before proceeding with the operation. This additional validation step ensures that there is enough data available to safely read the two bytes without risking an out-of-bounds read. By fixing this issue, the patch prevents the incorrect display of certificate texts mentioned in the CVE description and mitigates the associated security risk.
