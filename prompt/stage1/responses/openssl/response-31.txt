The root cause of CVE-2017-3735 is related to an improper bounds check within the parsing function for an IPAddressFamily extension in an X.509 certificate in OpenSSL. Specifically, the issue arises from the way OpenSSL handled the IPAddressFamily extension's address family (AFI) value retrieval.

Before the patch, the code assumed that the `f->addressFamily->data` was not `NULL` and that it contained at least two bytes of data (to represent the AFI value) without verifying the actual length of the data. This assumption led to a scenario where if the `addressFamily` field was present but contained less than two bytes, the code would still attempt to read two bytes (`data[0]` and `data[1]`). This would cause a one-byte overread past the end of the `addressFamily->data` buffer if it only contained a single byte. Such a buffer overread can potentially lead to undefined behavior, including incorrect program operation, crashes, and in certain contexts, could be leveraged for security vulnerabilities.

The patch addresses this root cause by adding a check for the `f->addressFamily->length` to ensure it is at least 2 bytes long before attempting to read the AFI value. This addition effectively prevents the one-byte overread by ensuring the read operation only proceeds when there is sufficient data available, thus avoiding out-of-bounds memory access.

By reinforcing the bounds check and validating the prerequisites before performing memory accesses, this fix mitigates the vulnerability and ensures that operations on the IPAddressFamily extension are handled securely, preventing potentially incorrect and unsafe behavior due to memory mismanagement.
