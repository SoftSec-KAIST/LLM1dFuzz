The root cause of CVE-2017-3735 is an improper bounds check on the buffer holding the IPAddressFamily extension data within an X.509 certificate. Specifically, the vulnerability is due to an assumption that the `addressFamily` field in this data structure contains at least two bytes of data. This assumption allows for the possibility of a one-byte overread when the code attempts to parse the address family identifier, which is expected to be two bytes long.

In the original code, there is no explicit check to ensure that the length of the `addressFamily`'s `data` field is sufficient to prevent an out-of-bounds read. The code incorrectly assumes that if `f->addressFamily` and `f->addressFamily->data` are not NULL, then it is safe to access the first two bytes of `data`. However, if `addressFamily->data` contains less than two bytes, accessing the second byte (`data[1]`) results in a buffer overread. This can lead to undefined behavior, including incorrect processing or display of the certificate's information, and in some cases, could potentially be exploited to leak information from the process memory or cause a crash.

The patch addresses this issue by explicitly checking that the `length` of the `addressFamily` field is at least 2 bytes before attempting to read the first two bytes. This ensures that access to `data[0]` and `data[1]` only occurs when there are at least two bytes available, thus preventing the out-of-bounds read. By adding this bounds check, the patch fixes the vulnerability and ensures that parsing the IPAddressFamily extension is safe from this particular type of buffer overread error.

In summary, the root cause is a lack of sufficient input validation (specifically, a missing bounds check on buffer length) when processing IPAddressFamily extensions in X.509 certificates, leading to a one-byte overread vulnerability. The fix properly validates the length of the data before accessing it, thereby mitigating the risk of out-of-bounds memory access.
