The root cause of CVE-2017-3735 lies in an insufficient validation of the size of an input buffer when parsing an IPAddressFamily extension in an X.509 certificate. Specifically, the original code did not check if the `addressFamily` field in an `IPAddressFamily` structure contained the expected length of data before attempting to access its elements. This led to the potential for a one-byte overread, wherein the code could attempt to read beyond the allocated memory for the `addressFamily->data` buffer. If the buffer was at the end of an allocated memory block, this overread could lead to accessing unallocated memory, which at best, results in incorrect data being read (and hence, an incorrect text display of the certificate) and at worst, could potentially be exploited to cause more severe issues depending on the memory layout and the system's state.

The patch fixes this issue by adding a check to ensure that the `addressFamily` field is not only non-null and contains data, but also that the `addressFamily->length` is at least 2 bytes long before attempting to read the two bytes needed to construct the returned value. This check prevents the out-of-bounds read by ensuring that there are enough bytes in the `addressFamily->data` to safely perform the subsequent operations. This represents a fundamental practice in secure coding: always validate the size of your input before performing operations on it to ensure the operations are safe and within the bounds of the allocated memory.
