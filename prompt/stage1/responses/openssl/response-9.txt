The root cause of CVE-2017-3735 is an out-of-bounds read vulnerability in the OpenSSL library while parsing the IPAddressFamily extension in X.509 certificates. Specifically, the vulnerability stems from the handling of the `addressFamily` field within the `IPAddressFamily` structure. The original implementation did not properly check if the `addressFamily` field was at least two bytes long before accessing its data, assuming that at least two bytes were always available for reading. This assumption could lead to a situation where the code would attempt to read beyond the allocated memory if the `addressFamily` data was less than two bytes, thus resulting in a one-byte overread.

The one-byte overread could not only cause incorrect display of certificate information due to improper parsing but also potentially lead to more severe security implications if the unexpected behavior could be exploited further by an attacker. However, the primary direct impact as described would be an incorrect text display of the certificate.

The patch addresses this issue by introducing a check to ensure the `addressFamily` field's `length` is at least two bytes (`f->addressFamily->length < 2`) before attempting to read the two-byte address family identifier. This change effectively prevents the out-of-bounds read by validating the length of the addressFamily field, ensuring that it contains enough data to be safely accessed as intended.

This problem underscores the importance of validating the length and integrity of input data before processing, especially in the context of security-critical functions such as certificate parsing within cryptographic libraries.
