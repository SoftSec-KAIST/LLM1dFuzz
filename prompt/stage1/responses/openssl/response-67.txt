Based on the provided details about CVE-2017-3735 and the corresponding patch, the root cause of this vulnerability seems to be an incorrect bounds check when parsing the IPAddressFamily extension in an X.509 certificate. Specifically, the original code did not properly ensure that the `addressFamily` object contained at least two bytes of data before attempting to access these bytes. This oversight could lead to a situation where, if the `addressFamily` object contained less than two bytes, an out-of-bounds read would occur when the code tried to access `f->addressFamily->data[1]`. This out-of-bounds read could potentially lead to undefined behavior, including incorrect display of the certificate's information.

The patch addresses this vulnerability by adding a crucial condition before proceeding with the extraction of data from `f->addressFamily->data`. It ensures that `f->addressFamily->length` is checked to be at least 2 bytes long (`|| f->addressFamily->length < 2`), thereby preventing the out-of-bounds read by ensuring that there are enough bytes to safely access. This addition of an explicit length check is a direct mitigation against the possibility of an out-of-bounds read, thus addressing the root cause of the vulnerability.

In summary, the root cause of CVE-2017-3735 was the lack of proper bounds checking before accessing elements within an object representing part of an X.509 certificate, leading to potential out-of-bounds reads. The fix introduces necessary checks to ensure that data access is within the bounds of the object's allocated memory, thus preventing this vulnerability.
