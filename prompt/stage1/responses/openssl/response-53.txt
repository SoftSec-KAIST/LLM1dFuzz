Based on the provided information about CVE-2017-3735 and examining the patch, the root cause of this vulnerability appears to be an insufficient validation of input data when parsing the IPAddressFamily extension in an X.509 certificate. Specifically, the code does not properly ensure that the `addressFamily` field has sufficient length before accessing its data, which could lead to a one-byte overread. This type of vulnerability typically occurs when the program assumes input will always conform to a certain format or length, without adequately checking that this is the case.

Here are the key points that lead to this conclusion:

1. **Insufficient Input Validation**: The original code does not check if the `addressFamily>length` is less than 2, which is required since it attempts to access `data[0]` and `data[1]`. The absence of this check allows for a situation where, if `addressFamily->length` is less than 2, accessing `data[1]` results in an out-of-bounds read.

2. **Patch Analysis**: The patch adds a crucial validation step by checking if `f->addressFamily->length < 2` before attempting to access `data[0]` and `data[1]`. If any of the conditions are not met, the function returns 0, effectively preventing the out-of-bounds read by ensuring that there's enough data to proceed safely.

3. **Type of Vulnerability**: The described issue is a classic example of a boundary error vulnerability, where input data is not properly validated, leading to potential security risks like information leakage or crashes. Specifically, it's an off-by-one error, as it involves a one-byte overread.

4. **Impact**: The direct impact, as described, seems relatively benign since it leads to an "incorrect text display of the certificate." However, the presence of such vulnerabilities in cryptographic libraries like OpenSSL can erode trust in these essential security components. In other contexts, similar vulnerabilities might be exploited in more impactful ways, such as executing arbitrary code or causing denial of service.

In summary, the root cause of CVE-2017-3735 is insufficient validation of the length of the `addressFamily` data before attempting to read from it, leading to a potential one-byte overread vulnerability when parsing IPAddressFamily extensions in X.509 certificates. The applied patch addresses this by adding the necessary checks to ensure that the data length is adequate before accessing it, which mitigates the vulnerability.
