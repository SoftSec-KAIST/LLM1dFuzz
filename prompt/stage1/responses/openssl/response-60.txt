Based on the provided patch and description for CVE-2017-3735, the root cause of the issue is an out-of-bounds read vulnerability in the OpenSSL library. Specifically, the vulnerability occurs during the parsing of an IPAddressFamily extension in an X.509 certificate due to insufficient validation of the length of the address family data before attempting to read it.

In the original code, thereâ€™s an assumption that `f->addressFamily->data` is at least two bytes long, as it tries to read these two bytes to construct an unsigned integer representing the address family identifier (AFI) without checking if `f->addressFamily->length` is sufficient to provide these two bytes. This can lead to a situation where if the length is less than 2 bytes, reading the second byte (`f->addressFamily->data[1]`) would go beyond the allocated buffer for `data`, leading to a one-byte overread. Overreading could potentially result in reading unintended memory, which might cause incorrect text display of the certificate or potentially leak sensitive information in a different context.

The patch fixes this issue by adding a condition to ensure that `f->addressFamily->length` is checked to be at least 2 bytes before attempting to read `f->addressFamily->data`. This prevents the out-of-bounds read by validating that the data to be accessed is within the bounds of the allocated memory, thereby addressing the root cause of the vulnerability.
