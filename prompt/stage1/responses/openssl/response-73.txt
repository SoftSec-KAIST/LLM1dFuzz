The root cause of CVE-2017-3735 lies in the improper handling of IPAddressFamily extension fields in X.509 certificates within OpenSSL. Specifically, the issue originates from an incorrect assumption that the `addressFamily` data will always be sufficiently long to read two bytes without verifying the actual length of the data available. This leads to a situation where the code may attempt to read beyond the allocated memory bounds (an overread), when parsing the `addressFamily` field of an IPAddressFamily extension, if this field's actual data length is less than two bytes.

Before the patch, the code simply checked for the non-nullity of the `f`, `f->addressFamily`, and `f->addressFamily->data` pointers and then proceeded to read two bytes from `f->addressFamily->data` without ensuring that `f->addressFamily->length` was at least two bytes long. 

The patch addresses this vulnerability by adding an additional check to ensure that `f->addressFamily->length` is at least two bytes (`|| f->addressFamily->length < 2`) before attempting to read these bytes. Thus, if any of the conditions for safe access are not met (i.e., any pointer is NULL or the length is insufficient), the function returns 0, avoiding the out-of-bounds read and ensuring the function behaves safely regardless of the input data.

This issue emphasizes the importance of rigorously validating the length of buffer data before accessing it, a common source of vulnerabilities in software dealing with complex data structures like those found in cryptographic protocols. Without proper validation, such vulnerabilities can lead to undefined behavior, crashes, or, in worse cases, exploitation vectors for attackers.
