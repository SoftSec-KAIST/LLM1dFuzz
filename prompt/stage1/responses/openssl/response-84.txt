The root cause of CVE-2017-3735 in the OpenSSL library is an out-of-bounds read issue while parsing an IPAddressFamily extension in an X.509 certificate. The flaw originates from insufficient validation of the length of the addressFamily data before accessing its contents. Specifically, the code prior to the fix did not check if the `addressFamily` structure contained enough data (`length < 2`) before attempting to read two bytes from its `data` field. This could lead to reading data beyond the actual memory allocated for `addressFamily->data`, resulting in a one-byte overread.

When parsing the AFI (Address Family Identifier) from the IPAddressFamily extension, the original code assumed that the `addressFamily->data` field contained at least two bytes without verifying this assumption. The oversight means that if the data were shorter than expected, the operation could access memory beyond what was allocated for `addressFamily->data`, leading to potentially undefined behavior.

The patch fixes this vulnerability by adding a condition that checks if `f->addressFamily->length` is less than 2 before attempting to read the two bytes to form the AFI. If the condition is not met (i.e., if the data is not long enough), the function returns 0, avoiding the out-of-bounds read. This ensures that access to `f->addressFamily->data[0]` and `f->addressFamily->data[1]` only occurs when there is sufficient data, thus mitigating the risk of incorrect memory access and the associated consequences of such actions.
