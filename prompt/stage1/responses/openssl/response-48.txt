The root cause of CVE-2017-3735 is an out-of-bounds read vulnerability in the OpenSSL library that occurs while parsing the IPAddressFamily extension in an X.509 certificate. Specifically, the vulnerability stems from insufficient validation of the `addressFamily` data length before attempting to read two bytes of data to derive the AFI (Address Family Identifier) value. In versions of OpenSSL before the fix, the code assumed that `f->addressFamily->data` was at least two bytes long without verifying this precondition. If the data was shorter than expected, the code would read beyond the allocated buffer (`f->addressFamily->data`), leading to a one-byte overread. This could potentially result in incorrect processing or display of the certificate information, but due to the nature of the issue (a simple one-byte overread), the practical impact in terms of security was likely limited to information disclosure or minor disruptions.

The fix introduced in the patch involves adding a precondition check to ensure that `f->addressFamily->length` is at least two bytes before proceeding to read the AFI value from `f->addressFamily->data`. This effectively prevents the out-of-bounds read by ensuring that the data buffer is sufficiently large to safely perform the desired operation, thus mitigating the vulnerability.

In summary, the root cause is a lack of proper length validation before accessing specific parts of the data buffer, which is a common type of vulnerability in software dealing with structured or variable-length input. The patch addresses this by adding the necessary validation steps.
