The root cause of CVE-2017-3735 in OpenSSL is related to how the software incorrectly handles parsing of the IPAddressFamily extension in an X.509 certificate. Specifically, this vulnerability stems from an out-of-bounds read issue. When OpenSSL attempts to parse and extract the address family identifier from an X.509 certificate extension, it does so by reading from the `addressFamily` field of the `IPAddressFamily` structure. The vulnerability occurs because the code originally did not properly check if the `addressFamily` data was at least two bytes long before attempting to access those bytes. This oversight leads to a situation where, if the data is shorter than expected (less than two bytes), the code could attempt to read beyond the allocated memory space for this field, resulting in a one-byte overread.

The essence of this vulnerability is a classic example of insufficient input validation, where the length of the input is not properly checked before accessing it. This could potentially lead to undefined behavior, including accessing memory areas that are not permitted, which might cause the program to crash or, in some cases, result in a security vulnerability by leaking memory contents.

The patch addresses this issue by adding a condition to check that the `addressFamily` is not NULL, the `addressFamily->data` is not NULL, and crucially, `addressFamily->length` is at least 2 bytes long before proceeding with the extraction of the address family identifier. This ensures that there is sufficient data to read, hence preventing the one-byte overread vulnerability. This fix thus ensures that the code behaves correctly by safely handling cases where the data might be shorter than expected and avoiding potentially dangerous out-of-bounds memory access.
