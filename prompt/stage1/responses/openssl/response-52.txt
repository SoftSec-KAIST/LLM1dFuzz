The root cause of CVE-2017-3735 in the OpenSSL library involves an issue with how an IPAddressFamily extension in an X.509 certificate is parsed. Specifically, the problem lies in performing a one-byte overread. This implies that when the code is attempting to read the address family data of an X.509 certificate, it does not adequately check the length of the data before proceeding to read from it. As a result, it potentially reads data beyond the buffer allocated for the IPAddressFamily extension, which can lead to the incorrect text display of the certificate.

The vulnerability stems from a lack of sufficient validation of the 'addressFamily' field's length in the IPAddressFamily structure before accessing its data. The original code before the patch suggests that it assumes at least two bytes of data are present without verifying this, which can lead to accessing and reading beyond the intended data structure.

The patch fixes this issue by adding a condition that checks if the `f->addressFamily->length` is less than 2, ensuring that there is enough data to safely perform the operation that combines two bytes into a single unsigned int value representing the address family identifier. If this condition is not met, it prevents the operation from proceeding and returns 0, effectively avoiding the out-of-bounds read.

This security vulnerability, identified as CVE-2017-3735, highlights the importance of rigorous input validation when handling data structures in security-sensitive software like OpenSSL. By enforcing proper checks on the length of data fields, software can prevent a range of potential vulnerabilities, including buffer overreads, which can lead to security breaches, information leaks, and incorrect data processing.
