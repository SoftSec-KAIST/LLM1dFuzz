The root cause of CVE-2017-3735 lies in the way OpenSSL parsed the IPAddressFamily extension in an X.509 certificate. Specifically, the vulnerability was due to an out-of-bounds read error. This occurs when a program attempts to read data past the end of an allocated buffer. In the context of OpenSSL before the patches for this CVE, the problematic code did not adequately check the length of the `addressFamily` data before attempting to access it. 

The original code made assumptions about the presence and size of `f->addressFamily->data` without verifying that it contained at least the two bytes needed to perform the bitwise operations `(f->addressFamily->data[0] << 8) | (f->addressFamily->data[1])`. This could lead to a situation where if the `addressFamily` data was less than two bytes, the code would try to read beyond its bounds, potentially accessing memory it was not supposed to. This could result in an incorrect display of the certificate's text because it might include data from adjacent memory locations not intended for display.

The patch addresses this root cause by adding a check to ensure that not only are all the required pointers (`f`, `f->addressFamily`, `f->addressFamily->data`) non-NULL, but also that the `f->addressFamily->length` is at least 2 bytes long before attempting to access the bytes and perform the bitwise operation. This effectively prevents the out-of-bounds read by ensuring the program does not attempt to read beyond the allocated buffer for the `addressFamily` data, thereby eliminating the possibility of the vulnerability.
