The root cause of CVE-2017-3735 is essentially a lack of proper input validation when parsing the IPAddressFamily extension in an X.509 certificate. This vulnerability stemmed from an assumption that the `addressFamily` field would always contain at least two bytes of data. The original code did not account for cases where the `addressFamily` might have a length less than 2 bytes, leading to an out-of-bounds read when attempting to access the second byte of the `addressFamily->data`.

The vulnerability is demonstrated in the difference between the original and patched versions of the code. In the original version, the size of the `addressFamily->data` was not checked before accessing its contents, assuming the presence of at least two bytes of data (for combining into an unsigned integer representing the AFI). This could potentially lead to reading data beyond the allocated memory if the `addressFamily->length` is less than 2, which might not only lead to erroneous display of certificate information but could also pose security risks if the memory contents are sensitive or if the behavior could be exploited for more nefarious purposes.

The patch corrects this by explicitly checking that the `addressFamily` is not `NULL`, that it contains a `data` field that is not `NULL`, and crucially, that the `length` of the `addressFamily` data is at least 2 bytes long before attempting to read the two bytes of data. If any of these conditions do not hold, the function now returns 0, avoiding the out-of-bounds read.

In summary, the root cause was a missing validation check for the length of the `addressFamily->data`, leading to potential out-of-bounds memory access. The fix addresses this by adding the necessary validation to ensure that there is enough data before attempting to access it.
