The root cause of CVE-2017-3735 involves an out-of-bounds read error when processing an IPAddressFamily extension in an X.509 certificate. The essence of the vulnerability lies in how OpenSSL, before the patch, handled the access to the `addressFamily` data within an `IPAddressFamily` structure without first properly verifying that sufficient data existed to perform such an access. 

Specifically, the original code assumed that `f->addressFamily` and `f->addressFamily->data` were not null and directly accessed the data at positions 0 and 1 to compute the Address Family Identifier (AFI). However, it did not check whether `f->addressFamily->length` was at least 2 to ensure that these two byte-accesses were safe. This oversight could lead to a scenario where the code would try to read beyond the allocated memory bound for `f->addressFamily->data`, resulting in a one-byte overread. Such out-of-bounds read behavior can lead to undefined behavior such as incorrect data being used in certificate text display or potentially more severe impacts depending on how the corrupted data is used subsequently by the application.

The patch corrects this vulnerability by introducing an additional condition before the data access: it verifies if `f->addressFamily->length` is less than 2, and if so, it immediately returns 0. This check ensures that there is at least two bytes of data available, effectively preventing the out-of-bounds read by ensuring the access is within the bounds of the allocated data before proceeding to extract the AFI using the two bytes of `addressFamily->data`.

This fix underscores the importance of thorough input validation and bounds checking when dealing with external data inputs, such as those found in X.509 certificates, to prevent similar vulnerabilities.
