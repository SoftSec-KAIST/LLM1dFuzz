The root cause of CVE-2017-3735 can be traced back to an insufficient verification of the length of an `IPAddressFamily` extension's data before accessing its content. Specifically, the vulnerability arises from a one-byte overread scenario where the code previously did not check if the `addressFamily` field's `data` was at least 2 bytes long before attempting to read the two-byte AFI (Address Family Identifier) value. This oversight could lead to reading beyond the allocated memory when the `data` contained less than two bytes.

In the vulnerable code, the AFI value is extracted by combining two adjacent bytes of data (`data[0]` shifted left by 8 bits and `data[1]`) without verifying the actual length of the `data`, assuming that there are always at least 2 bytes present. However, this assumption does not hold in all cases, especially when malformed or maliciously crafted certificates are parsed, which can lead to undefined behavior including incorrect display of text information from the certificate due to the overreading of memory.

The patch addresses this vulnerability by explicitly checking that the `addressFamily` field's `length` is at least 2 bytes before proceeding to read the two bytes. This check ensures that the function does not attempt to access memory beyond the allocated size for `data`, thereby preventing the one-byte overread. The return value is set to 0 (indicating failure or an absence of a valid AFI) if any of the conditions for a safe access are not met, such as if the `IPAddressFamily` structure or its `addressFamily` or `data` field is NULL, or if the `data` length is less than 2 bytes. This patch effectively mitigates the risk associated with this vulnerability by ensuring that the code behaves correctly even when parsing certificates with irregularly short `IPAddressFamily` extensions.
