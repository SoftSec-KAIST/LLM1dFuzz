The root cause of CVE-2017-3735 involves an improper validation mechanism while parsing the IPAddressFamily extension of an X.509 certificate, leading to a one-byte overread. This flaw is attributed to the absence of a critical check for the length of the address family information before accessing it.

In detail, the original code prior to the patch directly accesses the `addressFamily->data` array without ensuring that the `addressFamily->length` is sufficient to cover the accessed indices. This means if the `addressFamily->length` is less than 2 (since the code attempts to access `data[0]` and `data[1]`), it could lead to a situation where the code reads beyond the allocated memory for `addressFamily->data`. Such a scenario could cause undefined behavior, including potential memory corruption, incorrect processing, or in this specific case, an incorrect display of the certificate information.

The patch fixes this issue by adding a condition to verify not only the existence of `f`, `f->addressFamily`, and `f->addressFamily->data` but also that `f->addressFamily->length` is at least 2. This additional condition (`|| f->addressFamily->length < 2`) ensures that the subsequent operation to construct the address family identifier from `data[0]` and `data[1]` is safe and within bounds, preventing the one-byte overread.

Thus, the root cause can be summarized as a lack of adequate validation of the length of the data before its access, assuming the data structure would always meet the expected format, which was not necessarily the case. The fix properly addresses this assumption by introducing a length check to ensure safe access to the data array.
