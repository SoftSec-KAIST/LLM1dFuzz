The root cause of CVE-2017-3735 lies in the improper handling of the IPAddressFamily extension in an X.509 certificate, specifically in the `X509v3_addr_get_afi` function within `v3_addr.c`. Before the patch, the function did not adequately check that the `addressFamily` field had sufficient length before attempting to read the address family identification (AFI) value from its data. This could lead to a one-byte overread when the function attempted to access the second byte of data (`data[1]`) without ensuring that at least two bytes were available. This vulnerability could cause an incorrect display of the certificate's text, stemming from an out-of-bounds read.

The patch addresses this issue by adding a condition to check that the `addressFamily` field's length is at least 2 bytes (`f->addressFamily->length < 2` condition) before attempting to read the AFI value from its data. If the condition is not met (i.e., if `f` is null, if `f->addressFamily` is null, if `f->addressFamily->data` is null, or if `f->addressFamily->length` is less than 2), the function returns 0, thus averting the out-of-bounds read.

By ensuring that the length requirement is checked before data access, the patch effectively prevents the potential for an out-of-bounds read, addressing the root cause of the vulnerability.
