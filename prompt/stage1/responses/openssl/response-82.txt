The root cause of CVE-2017-3735 appears to be insufficient validation of input data when parsing the IPAddressFamily extension in an X.509 certificate, leading to a one-byte overread. Specifically, the original code did not check if the length of the `addressFamily` data was adequate before attempting to access its contents. This could lead to scenarios where the code would attempt to read data beyond the allocated memory for the `addressFamily` attribute, potentially resulting in incorrect text representation of the certificate or other unexpected behaviors. 

The patch addresses this vulnerability by adding a check to ensure that the `addressFamily` is not null, its data is not null, and most importantly, that the length of the `addressFamily` data is at least 2 bytes long before proceeding to extract the address family identifier. This effectively prevents the out-of-bounds read by validating that there is sufficient data to perform the intended operations, thereby ensuring the memory safety of the parsing function.
