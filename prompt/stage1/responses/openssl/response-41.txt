The root cause of CVE-2017-3735 stems from an insufficient validation of the length of the `addressFamily` field before accessing its data. Specifically, the original implementation assumed that if `f`, `f->addressFamily`, and `f->addressFamily->data` were not NULL, then it was safe to directly access the first two bytes of `f->addressFamily->data` to determine the address family identifier (AFI). This approach led to a one-byte overread in scenarios where `f->addressFamily->length` was less than 2 bytes, since it did not check whether the `addressFamily` field contained enough data to safely perform these operations.

The patch addresses this vulnerability by adding a length check (`f->addressFamily->length < 2`) before attempting to access the `addressFamily->data`. This ensures that there is enough data present to safely read the two-byte address family identifier without risking an out-of-bounds read. By requiring that the length of the `addressFamily` field is at least 2 bytes before proceeding with the data access, the patch effectively prevents the one-byte overread and eliminates the associated risk of incorrect text display of the X.509 certificate.

In summary, the root cause was a lack of adequate validation checks for the length of the `addressFamily` data before attempting to access it, leading to the possibility of out-of-bounds memory access. The patch remedied this by introducing the necessary validation to guard against this unsafe access.
