The root cause of CVE-2017-3735 in OpenSSL is an incorrect assumption about the safety of accessing data within an `IPAddressFamily` extension of an X.509 certificate without first validating that the expected amount of data is present. The original code snippet did not check if the address family data (`f->addressFamily->data`) contained at least two bytes before proceeding to access the data at indices 0 and 1. This oversight led to a situation where, if the data was less than 2 bytes, accessing `data[1]` would result in a one-byte overread, potentially accessing memory beyond the bounds of the `data` buffer.

This vulnerability is primarily a case of missing input validation, where the length of the data buffer is not verified before accessing it, leading to potential out-of-bounds read issues. Such vulnerabilities can cause undefined behavior, including crashes, incorrect processing, or in certain cases might lead to information disclosure, depending on how the out-of-bounds data is used by the application.

The patch addresses this issue by adding a condition to check that the `f->addressFamily` is not NULL, `f->addressFamily->data` is not NULL, and importantly, `f->addressFamily->length` is at least 2 bytes before attempting to retrieve the address family identifier from the data. This ensures that the subsequent access to `data[0]` and `data[1]` to assemble the address family identifier is safe and within the bounds of the buffer, thus avoiding the one-byte overread.

The oversight corrected by this patch highlights the importance of thoroughly validating all external input and the lengths of buffers before accessing their contents, especially in security-critical software like OpenSSL where vulnerabilities can have widespread implications.
