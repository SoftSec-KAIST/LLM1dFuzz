Based on the patch provided and the description, the root cause of CVE-2017-3735 appears to be an insufficient validation of the length of the address family data in an X.509 certificate's IPAddressFamily extension. Specifically, the original implementation in `X509v3_addr_get_afi` function performed a check to ensure that the `addressFamily` structure and its `data` field were not NULL. However, it did not check that the `data` field was long enough to contain at least two bytes before attempting to access them. 

When the function attempted to read two bytes (`data[0] << 8 | data[1]`) to return the address family identifier (AFI), it did not account for the possibility that the `data` field could be shorter than two bytes. If the `data` field contained less than two bytes, accessing `data[1]` could lead to a one-byte out-of-bounds read. This out-of-bounds read could potentially lead to incorrect information being displayed when parsing and displaying X.509 certificates, although the impact is largely limited to incorrect text display rather than execution of arbitrary code or a crash.

The patch addresses this issue by explicitly checking that `f->addressFamily->length` is at least two bytes long (`|| f->addressFamily->length < 2`) before proceeding to access the `data` bytes. If the precondition is not met (i.e., if `f` or `f->addressFamily` is NULL, or `data` is NULL, or the length of `data` is less than two bytes), the function now returns 0, effectively avoiding the out-of-bounds read.

Thus, the root cause of CVE-2017-3735 is a lack of proper input validation (specifically, length checking) when accessing structured data in an X.509 certificate. The patch corrects this issue by adding the necessary validation step to ensure the data is long enough before attempting to read from it.
