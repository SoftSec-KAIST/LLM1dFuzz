The root cause of CVE-2017-3735 is an out-of-bounds read issue stemming from improper validation of the length of an IPAddressFamily extension in an X.509 certificate. Specifically, the code prior to the patch does not ensure that the `addressFamily` data structure contains at least two bytes before attempting to read its contents to construct an address family identifier (AFI). The absence of such a check means that if the `addressFamily` data structure is too short, the code would still attempt to read two bytes from its `data` field, potentially accessing memory beyond the allocated buffer. This could lead to reading uninitialized or out-of-scope memory, manifesting as an incorrect text display of the certificate's information.

The patch addresses this vulnerability by explicitly checking that the `addressFamily` length is at least 2 before proceeding with the read operation. This ensures that there is no attempt to access data beyond the allocated memory, thus preventing the out-of-bounds read. The issue is fundamentally about ensuring proper input validation and handling edge cases where data structures do not conform to expected formats or sizes. This is a common source of vulnerabilities in software, underscoring the necessity for rigorous checks before data is accessed or processed.
