The root cause of CVE-2017-3735 stems from an oversight in properly checking the length of an `addressFamily` field before attempting to read from it. Specifically, the vulnerability lies in the handling of the IPAddressFamily extension within an X.509 certificate. The original code did not verify that the `addressFamily` field had sufficient data (at least 2 bytes) before attempting to read from it, leading to a potential one-byte overread.

This one-byte overread could occur because the code assumed the presence of at least two bytes (to form a 16-bit AFI, or Address Family Identifier) without actually checking if the `addressFamily->data` field contained at least 2 bytes. Consequently, if an X.509 certificate contained an IPAddressFamily extension with an `addressFamily` length of less than 2, the code would still attempt to read two bytes, resulting in an out-of-bounds read. This out-of-bounds read could lead to undefined behavior, potentially displaying incorrect information about the certificate or leading to other unforeseen issues.

The patch rectifies this issue by adding a check to ensure that the `addressFamily->length` is at least 2 bytes long before proceeding to read the AFI from the `addressFamily->data`. This additional length check prevents the one-byte overread by ensuring the data is sufficiently long enough to safely perform the bitwise operations needed to retrieve the AFI value. This solution addresses the root cause of the vulnerability by adding necessary validation checks that were previously absent, ensuring that operations on the `addressFamily->data` are performed safely and within bounds.
