The root cause of CVE-2017-3735 lies in an out-of-bounds read vulnerability when parsing an IPAddressFamily extension in an X.509 certificate. Specifically, the function `X509v3_addr_get_afi`, which is responsible for returning the Address Family Identifier (AFI) from an `IPAddressFamily` structure, previously did not properly check if the `addressFamily` field's `length` was sufficient before accessing its `data`. This could lead to accessing memory outside of the allocated range when attempting to construct the AFI value by reading two bytes from the `data` field. 

The vulnerability was due to assuming that the `addressFamily` field, a part of the X.509 certificate structure, always contains at least two bytes (enough to form a valid AFI) before accessing its `data` array. This assumption did not account for cases where this field could be shorter than expected, leading to a one-byte overread. This kind of error typically results from failing to validate input or assume safe input sizes, which is crucial in secure programming to prevent buffer overreads and similar memory safety issues.

The patch introduces additional checks to prevent this error by verifying not just the non-nullity and presence of necessary data in the `addressFamily` structure, but also by explicitly checking that the `addressFamily->length` is at least 2 bytes long before performing the operation that constructs the AFI. This change ensures that the program does not attempt to read beyond the allocated memory bound, mitigating the out-of-bounds read vulnerability.
