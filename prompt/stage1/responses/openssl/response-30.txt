The root cause of CVE-2017-3735 is an oversight in the handling of the IPAddressFamily extension within an X.509 certificate. Specifically, the vulnerability arises from a one-byte overread error, which occurs because the original code did not properly check that the `addressFamily` data structure contained at least two bytes before attempting to read two bytes from it to determine the Address Family Identifier (AFI).

The problematic code can lead to situations where, if the `addressFamily` data structure is not NULL but contains less than two bytes, the operation `((f->addressFamily->data[0] << 8) | (f->addressFamily->data[1]))` attempts to access memory that it shouldn'tâ€”hence, the overread. This could potentially result in unintended behavior, such as incorrect display of the certificate's information when parsed, because it might read and interpret memory adjacent to the intended buffer. This kind of vulnerability often opens the door to more severe exploitation scenarios, depending on how the out-of-bound read memory is used by the application.

The patch corrects this issue by inserting an additional condition to ensure that the length of the `addressFamily` data is at least two bytes long (`|| f->addressFamily->length < 2`). If any conditions leading to insufficient data are met, the function now safely returns 0, avoiding the attempt to read beyond the allocated memory for the `addressFamily` data. This effectively prevents the one-byte overread and secures the code against this specific misuse of memory, addressing the vulnerability described in CVE-2017-3735.
