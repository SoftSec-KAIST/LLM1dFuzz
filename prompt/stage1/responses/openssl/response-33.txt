Based on the information provided about CVE-2017-3735 and the patch, the root cause of the vulnerability can be attributed to an insufficient validation of input data, specifically the length of the addressFamily data in an IPAddressFamily extension of an X.509 certificate.

In the original code, there is an assumption that `f->addressFamily` and `f->addressFamily->data` are not NULL and contain at least two bytes (necessary to construct the `afi` value by combining the first two bytes). However, there was no explicit check to ensure that `f->addressFamily->length` is at least 2. This oversight led to the possibility of a one-byte overread, potentially resulting in access to memory beyond the intended bounds. This type of vulnerability usually occurs due to assumptions made by developers about the data they are handling, without properly validating those assumptions.

The patch addresses this root cause by introducing an explicit check for `f->addressFamily->length < 2`. This ensures that before attempting to access `f->addressFamily->data[0]` and `f->addressFamily->data[1]`, the code verifies there is enough data to read, thus avoiding out-of-bounds read. By adding this check, the patched code validates the preconditions for accessing data, ensuring that it does not attempt to read beyond the allocated memory for `f->addressFamily->data`, which effectively mitigates the vulnerability.

In summary, the root cause of CVE-2017-3735 is insufficient validation of the length of data in the `addressFamily` field of an IPAddressFamily extension in an X.509 certificate, leading to a potential out-of-bounds read. The fix introduced proper verification to avoid accessing memory outside the bounds of the data intended to be read.
