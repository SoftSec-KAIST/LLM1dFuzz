Based on the information provided and the patch details, the root cause of CVE-2017-3735 appears to be an out-of-bounds read vulnerability in the OpenSSL code that handles parsing the IPAddressFamily extension in an X.509 certificate. Specifically, the vulnerability arises from the code incorrectly assuming that `f->addressFamily->data` contains at least two bytes without properly verifying this assumption. This can lead to reading beyond the allocated memory when the assumption is violated, thus causing the one-byte overread.

The vulnerable code performed a bitwise operation to combine two adjacent bytes from `f->addressFamily->data` into a single unsigned integer without first checking if these two bytes are indeed available. The absence of a validation check to ensure that `f->addressFamily->length` is at least 2 bytes long before attempting to read these bytes is the direct cause of the vulnerability.

The patch addresses this issue by adding a condition that explicitly checks:

1. If the `IPAddressFamily` structure (`f`) is `NULL`.
2. If the `addressFamily` field within `f` is `NULL`.
3. If the `data` field within the `addressFamily` is `NULL`.
4. If the `length` of the `addressFamily` is less than 2 bytes.

Only if all these conditions are false (meaning the critical fields are not `NULL` and there are at least two bytes available in the `data`), the function proceeds to combine the two bytes into an unsigned integer. This fix ensures that an out-of-bounds read does not occur by validating the necessary conditions before accessing the memory.
