The root cause of CVE-2017-3735 lies in the improper handling of memory when parsing the IPAddressFamily extension in an X.509 certificate, leading to a potential one-byte overread. This issue results from the code not checking that the `addressFamily` data buffer in the `IPAddressFamily` structure is large enough before attempting to read two bytes from it to construct an address family identifier. 

In the original code, there is an assumption that if `f->addressFamily` and `f->addressFamily->data` are not `NULL`, they contain at least two bytes of data. However, there was no explicit check to ensure that `f->addressFamily->length` is at least 2, which means that if the length is 1, the operation of reading the second byte would go beyond the allocated buffer (`f->addressFamily->data[1]`), resulting in a one-byte overread.

The patch fixes this vulnerability by introducing an explicit condition that checks if `f->addressFamily->length` is less than 2. If this condition is true, or if any of the other pointed-to data structures are `NULL`, the function returns 0, effectively avoiding the out-of-bounds read. This change ensures that the code safely checks the size of the buffer before attempting to access it, preventing potential memory corruption or information leakage vulnerabilities that could arise from reading beyond the allocated memory buffer.
