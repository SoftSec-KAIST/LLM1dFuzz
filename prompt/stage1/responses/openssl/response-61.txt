The root cause of CVE-2017-3735 appears to be an inadequate validation of input data before its usage, specifically failing to check the length of the `addressFamily` data in an `IPAddressFamily` extension of an X.509 certificate before accessing it. Due to this oversight, the code could perform a one-byte overread beyond the intended buffer when it attempts to parse the `addressFamily` field, relying on this data to be at least 2 bytes long without verifying it. This misuse of the buffer could lead to unintended behavior such as incorrect text display of the certificate information.

The patch addresses this issue by adding a length check (`f->addressFamily->length < 2`) for the `addressFamily` data before trying to access its contents. This ensures that there is sufficient data to read, thus preventing the out-of-bounds read that led to the vulnerability. The fix effectively ensures that data is only accessed if the `addressFamily` field is not NULL, its data is not NULL, and it contains at least two bytes of information to form a valid address family identifier. With these checks in place, the corrected code avoids the kind of buffer overread error initially present, mitigating the risk associated with CVE-2017-3735.
