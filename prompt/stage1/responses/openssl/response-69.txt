The root cause of CVE-2017-3735 in OpenSSL is an out-of-bounds read issue while parsing the IPAddressFamily extension in an X.509 certificate. Specifically, the vulnerability arises when the code attempts to read data based on the assumption that there are sufficient bytes available in the `addressFamily->data` array to construct an unsigned int value from the first two bytes. However, if the `addressFamily->length` is less than 2, accessing `data[1]` results in a one-byte overread beyond the allocated buffer.

The problematic code before the fix does not check if the length of the `addressFamily->data` array is sufficient to safely access the first two bytes. Such an oversight leads the code to potentially read beyond the allocated memory of `addressFamily->data`, resulting in undefined behavior, which could manifest as an incorrect text display of the certificate. This kind of memory safety vulnerability is common in C and C++ programs, where manual memory management and direct memory access without bounds checking can lead to security issues.

The patch addresses this issue by adding a condition to check that `f->addressFamily` is not `NULL`, `f->addressFamily->data` is not `NULL`, and importantly, that `f->addressFamily->length` is at least 2 before proceeding to construct the unsigned int. By enforcing this check, the patch ensures that the code does not attempt to read beyond the allocated memory, thus avoiding the out-of-bounds read and fixing the vulnerability.

In summary, the root cause of CVE-2017-3735 is a lack of adequate bounds checking before reading memory, which the patch corrects by adding the necessary validation to ensure the safety and correctness of memory access.
