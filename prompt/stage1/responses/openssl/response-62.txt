Based on the provided information and patch, the root cause of CVE-2017-3735 is an out-of-bounds read error that occurs when parsing an IPAddressFamily extension in an X.509 certificate. Specifically, the vulnerability is triggered when attempting to access data beyond the allocated memory of the addressFamily structure's data field. This can occur due to insufficient validation of the `addressFamily` length before attempting to read the address family identifier (AFI).

In the original code, there are conditions to ensure that `f`, `f->addressFamily`, and `f->addressFamily->data` are not null. However, it directly uses `data[0]` and `data[1]` to form an unsigned integer without verifying that `f->addressFamily->length` is at least 2, which is required for the two-byte read operation. This oversight leads to a situation where if the `addressFamily` data field has a length of less than 2, accessing `data[1]` would access memory beyond the intended buffer. Such behavior not only results in incorrect program operation, potentially displaying incorrect text for the certificate but also poses a security risk.

The patch addresses this vulnerability by adding a check (`|| f->addressFamily->length < 2`) to ensure that the `addressFamily->data` field has sufficient length to safely perform the following operation: `(f->addressFamily->data[0] << 8) | f->addressFamily->data[1];`. If any of the conditions are not met, it safely returns `0`, effectively preventing an out-of-bounds read by ensuring that the read operation is only attempted when there is enough data to read, hence mitigating the vulnerability and ensuring safe parsing of X.509 certificates.
