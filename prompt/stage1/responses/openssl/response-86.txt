The root cause of CVE-2017-3735 is an issue in the OpenSSL library's handling of the IPAddressFamily extension in X.509 certificates, leading to a one-byte overread. This problem occurs due to insufficient validation of the length of the `addressFamily` field before accessing its data. 

In the original code, the function `X509v3_addr_get_afi` attempts to extract a two-byte AFI (Address Family Identifier) value from the `addressFamily` field of an `IPAddressFamily` structure. However, it assumes that the `addressFamily->data` is non-NULL and contains at least two bytes of data without explicitly checking the length of this data. If the `addressFamily` field is shorter than expected, the code would attempt to read beyond the end of the allocated memory (an overread), possibly leading to undefined behavior including incorrect display of certificate text or more severe memory-related errors.

The provided patch addresses this vulnerability by adding a check on the length of `addressFamily->data` to ensure it contains at least two bytes (`f->addressFamily->length < 2`) before attempting to extract the AFI value. If the checks fail (either because `f`, `f->addressFamily`, `f->addressFamily->data` are NULL, or the length is insufficient), the function now returns 0, thereby avoiding the out-of-bounds read and mitigating the vulnerability.

In summary, the root cause is insufficient validation of input data length before memory access, a common issue in vulnerabilities related to memory corruption. The patch fixes this by ensuring the necessary conditions are met before accessing the memory, thereby preventing the out-of-bounds read.
