The root cause of CVE-2017-3735 is an out-of-bounds read issue in the OpenSSL code responsible for parsing the IPAddressFamily extension in X.509 certificates. Specifically, the vulnerability stems from the faulty assumption that the `addressFamily` field within an `IPAddressFamily` structure always contains sufficient data to be read without validating the length of the data prior to access.

The original code incorrectly assumes that if the `addressFamily` pointer, as well as its `data` pointer, are non-NULL, it is safe to read the first two bytes of the data to construct an address family identifier. This leads to a scenario where, if the `addressFamily->data` contains less than 2 bytes, accessing the second byte (`data[1]`) results in an out-of-bounds read, potentially accessing memory adjacent to the intended buffer. This could lead to incorrect data being used in the processing of the certificate, specifically in the textual representation of the address family extracted from the X.509 certificate.

The patch fixes this vulnerability by adding a check to ensure that `addressFamily->length` is at least 2 bytes long before attempting to read the two bytes of data. This prevents the out-of-bounds read by verifying that there is enough data to safely access. By doing this, it guarantees that the operation to construct the address family identifier only proceeds when there is sufficient data, thus avoiding the risk of reading beyond the bounds of the allocated memory.

In summary, the root cause of CVE-2017-3735 is an assumption that led to an out-of-bounds read due to a lack of sufficient validation of the length of the `addressFamily->data` before accessing its contents. The patch addresses this issue by introducing a necessary length check.
