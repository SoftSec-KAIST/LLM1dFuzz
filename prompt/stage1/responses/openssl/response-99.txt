The root cause of CVE-2017-3735 in OpenSSL is an off-by-one error that occurs while parsing the IPAddressFamily extension in an X.509 certificate. The bug specifically arises due to a failure to properly check the length of the addressFamily data before accessing its bytes.

In the original, vulnerable code, there is an assumption that `f->addressFamily->data` is non-null and contains at least two bytes (to represent the AFI, Address Family Identifier), without actually checking if the `addressFamily->length` is sufficient to guarantee this. This absence of a check leads to a scenario where, if the `addressFamily` is shorter than expected (less than 2 bytes), the code would still attempt to read two bytes. This behavior results in a one-byte overread beyond the allocated buffer, which could potentially lead to an incorrect text display of the certificate, or, in worse cases, could be utilized in a way that might lead to more insidious exploits, depending on how the out-of-bounds data is used or interpreted by the application.

The patch addresses this vulnerability by adding a preliminary check to ensure that not only the `f`, `f->addressFamily`, and `f->addressFamily->data` are non-null but also that `f->addressFamily->length` is at least 2. This ensures that there is enough data to safely read the two bytes needed to form the AFI without overstepping the memory bounds. If any of these conditions are not met, the function now returns 0, which safely avoids the out-of-bounds read.

In essence, the fix strengthens the validation process before accessing specific data within a data structure, adhering to a common principle in secure programming to always verify the size of your buffers before accessing their contents.
