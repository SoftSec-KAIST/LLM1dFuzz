The root cause of CVE-2017-3735 in the OpenSSL library is an out-of-bounds read issue during the parsing of the IPAddressFamily extension of an X.509 certificate. Specifically, before the patch, the code did not check if the `addressFamily` field had sufficient data before attempting to read from its `data` array. This oversight meant that if the `addressFamily` field was less than the expected length, the code would still attempt to read two bytes (`data[0]` and `data[1]`), potentially accessing memory outside of the allocated buffer. This behaviour could lead to a one-byte overread, resulting in incorrect text displays of the certificate or potentially causing other undefined behaviour based on the contents of the adjacent memory.

The patch addresses this issue by introducing a condition that checks for `NULL` pointers and verifies the `length` of the `addressFamily` field is at least 2 bytes long before proceeding with the read operation. By doing so, it ensures that the operation does not go beyond the bounds of the allocated memory, thereby avoiding the out-of-bounds read condition and making the parsing process more secure. 

This vulnerability highlights the importance of thoroughly validating all inputs and lengths before accessing memory in security-critical software like OpenSSL.
