The root cause of CVE-2017-3735 in OpenSSL involves an improper handling error that occurs while parsing an IPAddressFamily extension in an X.509 certificate, specifically a one-byte overread. This vulnerability arises from the code not properly checking the length of the addressFamily data before attempting to access its content. The essence of the vulnerability lies in the assumption that the addressFamily data is always at least two bytes long, without verifying this assumption.

Originally, the code simply proceeded to combine the first two bytes of the addressFamily data to form an AFI (Address Family Identifier) value without first ensuring that there were indeed at least two bytes available to read. This leads to a scenario where, if the addressFamily data is less than two bytes, the code would read beyond the allocated buffer (overread) for this data structure. An overread can cause various issues, including incorrect processing or display of certificate information, and potentially could be exploited to leak information from process memory, depending on how the overread data is used by the application.

The patch addresses this vulnerability by adding a condition to check that the `addressFamily` is not `NULL`, its `data` is not `NULL`, and crucially, that the `length` of the `addressFamily` data is at least 2 bytes before proceeding to access the data to extract the AFI value. If any of these conditions are not met, the function returns 0, safely avoiding the overread. This ensures that the code behaves correctly regardless of the actual length of the `addressFamily` data, thus correcting the root cause of the vulnerability.
