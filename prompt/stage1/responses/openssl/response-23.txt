The root cause of CVE-2017-3735 stems from how OpenSSL parsed the IPAddressFamily extension in an X.509 certificate, specifically, an improper handling of the address family (AFI) information associated with the certificate. Before the patch, the code assumed that `f->addressFamily` and `f->addressFamily->data` were both not NULL and that they contained at least two bytes of data to represent the AFI. This assumption led to a scenario where, if the actual data was shorter than expected (less than 2 bytes), the code would still attempt to access these two bytes (`f->addressFamily->data[0]` and `f->addressFamily->data[1]`) without verifying the length of the data. As a result, this led to a potential one-byte overread situation. 

An overread occurs when the program reads data beyond the boundary of allocated memory. Although this particular vulnerability only caused an incorrect text display of the certificate rather than a more severe security issue (like arbitrary code execution), it signifies a lapse in proper input validation and buffer boundary checkingâ€”a common source of bugs in software dealing with network protocols and binary data formats.

The patch addresses this root cause by adding a condition to check that `f->addressFamily` is not only non-NULL but also that `f->addressFamily->length` is at least 2 bytes long before attempting to access those bytes to construct the AFI value. By doing this, it ensures that there is a sufficient amount of data to read, preventing the out-of-bounds read issue.

This case underlines the importance of rigorous input validation and checking the length of buffers before accessing them, especially in software components as widely used and critical for security as OpenSSL.
