The root cause of CVE-2017-3735 is the mishandling of the memory when parsing the IPAddressFamily extension in an X.509 certificate. Specifically, the flaw arises from an assumption that the `addressFamily` field in the `IPAddressFamily` structure always contains at least two bytes of data, which corresponds to the AFI (Address Family Identifier). This assumption leads to a dangerous operation where the code attempts to access two bytes (`data[0]` and `data[1]`) without first ensuring that at least two bytes are actually available. When the `addressFamily` field is shorter than expected, this results in a one-byte overread.

This kind of vulnerability typically arises when input validation or bounds checking is insufficient or incorrect. In this specific case, the original code did not check that the `length` of the `addressFamily->data` was at least 2, which is necessary to safely perform the two-byte read operation.

The patch addresses this flaw by adding a condition to check that `f->addressFamily->length` is at least 2 bytes long before attempting to read the two bytes. This effectively prevents the out-of-bounds read by ensuring that the operation is only performed when the data is guaranteed to be within bounds, thus resolving the issue and mitigating the risk of potentially exploitable behavior.

This bug underscores the importance of careful bounds checking and input validation when handling user-supplied or external data, especially in security-critical software like OpenSSL. Incorrect assumptions about data length or content can lead to vulnerabilities that might remain undetected for extensive periods, as seen in this case where the bug was present since 2006.
