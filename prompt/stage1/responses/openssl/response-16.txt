The root cause of CVE-2017-3735 in OpenSSL is an out-of-bounds read vulnerability that stems from improper validation of the length of an address family (AFI) information within the IPAddressFamily extension in an X.509 certificate. Specifically, when parsing the address family information to get the Address Family Identifier (AFI), the original code did not check if the `addressFamily` field's length is sufficient. This could lead to reading data beyond the allocated memory when accessing the second byte (`data[1]`) of the `addressFamily` data.

In the provided patch, the fix involves introducing a condition to check not only if the various pointers (`f`, `f->addressFamily`, and `f->addressFamily->data`) are non-NULL, but also if the `addressFamily->length` is at least 2 bytes long, which is necessary for forming a valid AFI by combining `data[0]` and `data[1]`. If these conditions are not met, the function now returns 0, effectively avoiding the out-of-bounds read and ensuring that only a valid and correctly sized Address Family is processed.

The essence of the vulnerability lies in assuming that the data is well-formed without verifying the actual length of the data, which could lead to an attempt to read beyond the allocated memory space, potentially causing incorrect data to be read or displayed, application crashes, or in some cases, could be exploited for more malicious purposes if an attacker carefully crafts the certificate to control or influence what data is read beyond the boundary.
