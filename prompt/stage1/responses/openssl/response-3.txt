The root cause of CVE-2017-3735 is an out-of-bounds read error that occurs while parsing the IPAddressFamily extension in an X.509 certificate. The specific issue stems from the code not properly checking the length of the `addressFamily` data before reading from it. In the original implementation, the code assumed that the `addressFamily` data was always at least two bytes long, since it directly accessed `data[0]` and `data[1]` without verifying the actual length of the `data` array. 

This assumption could lead to a situation where, if the `addressFamily` data were shorter than two bytes, accessing `data[1]` would result in reading beyond the allocated memory for the `data` array. An out-of-bounds read can lead to various unwanted behaviors, including incorrect processing or representation of the certificate's information, potentially causing security vulnerabilities by misrepresenting certificate details or causing crashes in scenarios where the invalid memory read results in illegal operations.

The patch fixes this issue by adding a check that ensures the `addressFamily` is not `NULL` and that its `length` is at least 2 bytes before proceeding to extract the AFI (Address Family Identifier) value from the `data` array. This check prevents the out-of-bounds read by validating that there is sufficient data to safely access `data[0]` and `data[1]`, effectively mitigating the vulnerability described in CVE-2017-3735.
