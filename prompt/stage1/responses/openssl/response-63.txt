The root cause of CVE-2017-3735 is an improper validation of the length of an input buffer before reading two bytes from it. This oversight could lead to reading beyond the allocated memory space (one-byte overread) when parsing an IPAddressFamily extension in an X.509 certificate. The specific issue stems from the assumption that the `addressFamily` ASN.1 element within the X.509 certificate structure is at least two bytes long, without proper verification of this precondition.

In the original code, there was no check to ensure that the `f->addressFamily->length` was of sufficient size before attempting to read two bytes from its `data` field. The code incorrectly assumed that if `f`, `f->addressFamily`, and `f->addressFamily->data` were not NULL, it was safe to read two bytes for forming the returned address family identifier.

The fix introduced proper validation by adding a condition to check if `f->addressFamily->length` is less than 2. If this condition or any of the earlier checks (nullity checks for `f`, `f->addressFamily`, and `f->addressFamily->data`) fails, the function now returns 0, avoiding the out-of-bounds read. This correction ensures that the function can safely extract the address family identifier only when the data is of an expected length, effectively preventing the vulnerability from being exploited and ensuring that memory outside of the `addressFamily->data` buffer is not accessed.
