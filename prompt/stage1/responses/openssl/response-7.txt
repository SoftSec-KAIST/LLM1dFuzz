The root cause of CVE-2017-3735 is an out-of-bounds read issue due to insufficient validation of the length of an IPAddressFamily extension's address family data in an X.509 certificate. When OpenSSL attempts to parse the IPAddressFamily extension, it assumes that the `addressFamily->data` field contains at least two bytes (needed to construct an AFI (Address Family Identifier)). However, before the patch, there was no check to ensure that `addressFamily->length` was at least 2 bytes long before attempting to access the first two bytes of the data. This lack of validation could lead to a situation where if the `addressFamily->data` is less than 2 bytes, the code could attempt to read beyond the allocated memory for the `addressFamily->data`, resulting in a one-byte overread. This overread could lead to incorrect text display of the certificate and potentially other undefined behavior depending on the context in which the malformed certificate is processed.

The patch fixes this issue by adding a condition to check whether `f->addressFamily` is null, its `data` is null, or its `length` is less than 2 bytes before attempting to read from `addressFamily->data`. If any of these conditions are true, the function now returns 0, thereby preventing the out-of-bounds read. This ensures that the software does not read beyond the allocated memory, mitigating the risk associated with processing specially crafted X.509 certificates.
