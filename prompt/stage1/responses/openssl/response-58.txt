The root cause of CVE-2017-3735 is an out-of-bounds read issue while parsing the IPAddressFamily extension in an X.509 certificate. Specifically, when OpenSSL attempts to read the address family (AFI) from an IPAddressFamily structure, it does not properly check that the `addressFamily` ASN.1 element is at least two bytes long before attempting to access its contents. The code before the patch assumes that the `addressFamily` field and its `data` pointer are not NULL and directly tries to access the first two bytes to combine them into an address family identifier.

This vulnerability arises due to a lack of bounds checking before reading the data. The assumption that there are at least two bytes available leads to a situation where, if the `addressFamily` element is less than two bytes, the code would read beyond the allocated memory for the `data` buffer (a one-byte overread). This could potentially lead to incorrect processing or display of the certificate's information based on out-of-bounds data, which might manifest as a more subtle bug or potentially exploitable behavior depending on how the out-of-bounds data interacts with application logic.

The commit fixing the issue adds a check to ensure that the `addressFamily` length is at least two bytes before proceeding with the read operation. This prevents the out-of-bounds read by ensuring the code does not attempt to access data beyond the buffer's actual size. This kind of vulnerability underscores the importance of validating the size and bounds of buffers before accessing their contents, especially in security-sensitive code that parses externally supplied data structures like X.509 certificates.
