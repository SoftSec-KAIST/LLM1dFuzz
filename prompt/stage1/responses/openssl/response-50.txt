The root cause of CVE-2017-3735 lies in the handling of IPAddressFamily extensions within X.509 certificates in OpenSSL. Specifically, the issue stems from a one-byte overread error which could occur while parsing the addressFamily field of an IPAddressFamily extension. The parsing code did not properly validate that the `addressFamily->data` field contained at least two bytes before attempting to read two bytes from it. This could potentially lead to reading data beyond the intended buffer, resulting in incorrect display text of the certificate information and potentially causing other undefined behavior depending on how the out-of-bound data is used.

The vulnerability is a classic example of an insufficient input validation leading to an out-of-bounds read. Properly checking the length of the input data before accessing it is a fundamental principle in secure programming to prevent buffer overflow and overread vulnerabilities. The absence of such a check allowed an attacker to craft a certificate that, when processed by an application using a vulnerable version of OpenSSL, could exploit this flaw.

The patch for this vulnerability adds a check to ensure that `f->addressFamily` is not NULL, that `f->addressFamily->data` is not NULL, and crucially, that `f->addressFamily->length` is at least 2 before attempting to read two bytes from `f->addressFamily->data`. This effectively prevents the out-of-bounds read by ensuring that the required amount of data is present before accessing it, thus addressing the root cause of CVE-2017-3735.
