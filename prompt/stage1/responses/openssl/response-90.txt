The root cause of CVE-2017-3735 stems from an out-of-bounds read error while parsing an IPAddressFamily extension in an X.509 certificate. This specific vulnerability arises because the original code did not adequately check that the `addressFamily` field of an `IPAddressFamily` structure contains enough data before proceeding to access its contents. 

In the original code:

```c
return ((f != NULL &&
         f->addressFamily != NULL && f->addressFamily->data != NULL)
        ? ((f->addressFamily->data[0] << 8) | (f->addressFamily->data[1]))
        : 0);
```

There is an assumption that if `f`, `f->addressFamily`, and `f->addressFamily->data` are not NULL, then it is safe to access the first two bytes of `f->addressFamily->data`. This assumption neglects to consider cases where `f->addressFamily->length` might be less than 2, leading to a scenario where attempting to read the second byte (`f->addressFamily->data[1]`) could read beyond the allocated memory bounds if the length is less than 2. This out-of-bounds read can lead to undefined behavior, potentially resulting in an incorrect text display of the certificate as noted in the CVE description.

The provided patch addresses this issue by explicitly checking that `f->addressFamily->length` is at least 2 before attempting to read the two bytes needed to form the returned value:

```c
if (f == NULL
        || f->addressFamily == NULL
        || f->addressFamily->data == NULL
        || f->addressFamily->length < 2)
    return 0;
return (f->addressFamily->data[0] << 8) | f->addressFamily->data[1];
```

This change ensures that an out-of-bounds read does not occur by validating that the necessary length of data is present before proceeding with the data access. Thus, the root cause is fundamentally a missing validation step on the length of a specified field within a data structure, which the patch correctly addresses by adding a check for the `f->addressFamily->length`.
