The root cause of CVE-2017-3735 in the OpenSSL library is related to improper bounds checking when parsing the IPAddressFamily extension in an X.509 certificate. Specifically, the vulnerability is due to a one-byte overread that can occur because the original code did not adequately check the length of the `addressFamily` data before trying to access its content.

In the affected code, the `X509v3_addr_get_afi` function attempts to read two bytes from the `f->addressFamily->data` array without first verifying that the array contains enough data to prevent reading beyond its end. This leads to a situation where, if the `addressFamily` structure was malformed or shorter than expected, the code would read beyond the allocated memory for `data`. This one-byte overread could then result in incorrect interpretation or display of the certificate's information and theoretically could be leveraged in more complex attacks, depending on the context and how the affected function is used within applications.

The patch corrects this issue by adding a condition to check that `f->addressFamily->length` is at least 2 bytes long before attempting to access the `data` array. By verifying the length, the code ensures that reading the two bytes necessary to form the AFI (Address Family Identifier) value does not exceed the bounds of the `data` array, thus preventing the out-of-bounds read and resolving the vulnerability.

This fix changes the logic from merely checking if the `addressFamily` and its `data` are non-NULL to a more robust validation that also includes checking the actual length of the data. This kind of check is a common defensive programming practice to prevent buffer over-read vulnerabilities, which are common in C and C++ programs dealing with raw pointers and manual memory management.
