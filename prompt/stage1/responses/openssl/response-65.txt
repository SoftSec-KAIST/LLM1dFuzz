The root cause of CVE-2017-3735 stems from an inadequate validation of the length of the `addressFamily` data before accessing it. In the original code, there was an attempt to access `f->addressFamily->data` without first confirming that there are at least two bytes available to read. This oversight led to a potential one-byte overread when the function attempted to compose a 16-bit address family identifier from an array that might only hold a single byte or no data at all. 

This vulnerability arises because the original implementation assumes the presence of at least two bytes (`data[0]` and `data[1]`) in `f->addressFamily->data` without verifying that `f->addressFamily->length` is sufficient to contain these two bytes. This assumption can lead to accessing data beyond the allocated memory region assigned to `f->addressFamily->data`, which constitutes an out-of-bounds read. Such reads can cause various issues, including incorrect processing or representation of data, crashes due to accessing illegal memory areas, and potentially could be exploited to leak memory contents post-processing, although the CVE description primarily mentions an incorrect text display of the certificate, not a direct security exploitation scenario.

The patch fixes this by adding a condition to ensure that `f->addressFamily->length` is checked to be at least 2 bytes long before proceeding with accessing `data[0]` and `data[1]`. This effectively prevents the out-of-bounds read by guaranteeing that the requisite number of bytes exists and is safe to access, thus rectifying the weakness in the original code.
