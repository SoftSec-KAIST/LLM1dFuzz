The root cause of CVE-2017-3735 lies in an improper validation of the length of the addressFamily data in an IPAddressFamily extension of an X.509 certificate. Specifically, the original code did not check if the `addressFamily` field had sufficient length before accessing its data. This could lead to a situation where the code could attempt to access data beyond the allocated memory for the `addressFamily->data`, resulting in a one-byte overread. This overread could potentially be leveraged to cause a variety of impacts, from incorrect text display of the certificate to potentially more serious vulnerabilities depending on the context in which the overread memory is used.

The patch addresses this issue by adding a check to ensure that the `addressFamily->length` is at least 2 before attempting to access `addressFamily->data[0]` and `addressFamily->data[1]`. This ensures that there is no out-of-bounds memory access, which eliminates the risk of the one-byte overread vulnerability. Essentially, it ensures the integrity and safety of memory access operations within the function `X509v3_addr_get_afi` by verifying that there's enough data to work with before proceeding with data access.
