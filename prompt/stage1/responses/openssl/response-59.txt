Based on the description of CVE-2017-3735 and the provided patch to OpenSSL, the root cause of the vulnerability appears to be an improper validation of the length of the `addressFamily` data when parsing the IPAddressFamily extension in an X.509 certificate. Specifically, the original code did not check if the `addressFamily` data was of sufficient length before attempting to access its content, leading to the possibility of a one-byte overread beyond the allocated memory. This is because the code assumed that if `f->addressFamily` and `f->addressFamily->data` were not NULL, it was safe to directly access the first two bytes of data.

The one-byte overread could potentially lead to reading data adjacent to the allocated buffer, which varies depending on the contents and layout of memory. Although this vulnerability may result primarily in an incorrect display of the certificate's text, exploiting such memory safety issues could potentially have more serious implications, including leaking sensitive information or assisting in executing further exploits, depending on the context and how the affected software is utilized within a system.

The patch fixes this vulnerability by ensuring that a length check is performed (`|| f->addressFamily->length < 2`) before attempting to access the first two bytes of the `addressFamily->data`. This validation step ensures that there is enough data to safely perform the operation, thereby preventing the out-of-bounds read. Essentially, the patch enforces proper input validation and bounds checking, which are fundamental to preventing many types of software vulnerabilities, especially those related to memory corruption or out-of-bounds access.

In summary, the root cause of CVE-2017-3735 is a missing bounds check before reading memory data, leading to the possibility of accessing beyond the intended buffer.
