The root cause of CVE-2017-3735 in OpenSSL appears to be a failure to properly validate the length of the `addressFamily` data before accessing its contents. Specifically, the code was reading two bytes of data (`data[0]` and `data[1]`) to construct an address family identifier without first ensuring that the `addressFamily` contains at least two bytes of data. This oversight led to a potential one-byte overread when the `addressFamily` was shorter than expected.

In the original code snippet provided in the patch, it shows that the code attempted to perform a bitwise operation to combine `data[0]` and `data[1]` into a single unsigned int to represent the address family identifier without checking if `addressFamily->length` was sufficient to guarantee that both bytes were valid and accessible. Without this check, if the `addressFamily` contained less than two bytes, accessing `data[1]` would result in reading beyond the allocated memory for `addressFamily->data`, leading to undefined behavior and potentially leaking sensitive information or causing a crash due to an out-of-bounds read.

The patch addresses this issue by adding a condition to ensure that `addressFamily->length` is at least 2 before proceeding to access `data[0]` and `data[1]`. If `addressFamily` is NULL, `addressFamily->data` is NULL, or `addressFamily->length` is less than 2, the function now safely returns 0, thus avoiding the out-of-bounds read and mitigating the associated security risk. This change ensures that the function behaves correctly and safely even when presented with malformed or unexpected input.
