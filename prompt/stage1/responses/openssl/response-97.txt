The root cause of CVE-2017-3735 can be attributed to an insufficient validation of the length of the addressFamily data in an X.509 certificate's IPAddressFamily extension. Initially, the code did not thoroughly check if the `addressFamily` data structure had an adequate length before accessing its contents. This could lead to a one-byte overread, where the code would access data beyond the intended buffer. Such a situation arises because the original code assumes there are at least two bytes of data available (`data[0]` and `data[1]`) without verifying this by checking the `addressFamily->length`.

The patch rectifies this issue by introducing a condition that verifies whether `f->addressFamily` is not `NULL`, its `data` is not `NULL`, and importantly, that the `length` of the `addressFamily` data is at least 2 bytes long before it proceeds to retrieve the address family information. If any of these conditions are not met, it returns 0, effectively preventing the out-of-bounds read. This ensures that the function no longer attempts to access `data[0]` and `data[1]` unless it is safe to do so, addressing the vulnerability. 

By ensuring the necessary checks on the length of the data, the patch safeguards against the potential misuse of the memory access, thereby protecting the system from a class of memory errors that could lead to crashes, incorrect data handling, or potentially exploitable conditions.
