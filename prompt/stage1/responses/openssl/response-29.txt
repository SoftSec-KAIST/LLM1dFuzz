The root cause of CVE-2017-3735 appears to be related to improperly handling the length of the addressFamily data in an X.509 certificate, which could lead to a one-byte overread when parsing an IPAddressFamily extension. This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of the existence and size of the `addressFamily` field before accessing its data based on the assumption that it contains at least two bytes necessary to construct the address family identifier (AFI).

Analyzing the patch, the original code did not check if the `addressFamily` length is at least 2 bytes before attempting to read these bytes. The modification introduced in the patch adds a check (`f->addressFamily->length < 2`) to ensure that there's sufficient data available to read, thereby preventing the out-of-bounds read. If any condition is not met, the function now returns `0`, indicating an error or an invalid condition safely, without performing the out-of-bounds read.

This vulnerability represents a classic example of improper input validation, where the assumption that input will always be well-formed or conform to expected sizes leads to security weaknesses. The fix correctly adds the necessary validation steps to ensure that the program does not attempt to read beyond the allocated memory for the `addressFamily` data, eliminating the risk of accessing memory out of bounds.
