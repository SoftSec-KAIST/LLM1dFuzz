The root cause of CVE-2017-3735 involves improper validation of the length of the addressFamily data before accessing it, leading to a potential out-of-bounds read. Specifically, the original implementation assumed the addressFamily's `data` array contains at least two bytes (necessary to construct the AFI) without verifying this precondition, hence reading beyond the allocated buffer when this is not the case.

This vulnerability resides in the function `X509v3_addr_get_afi` within the file `v3_addr.c`, which is responsible for parsing the IPAddressFamily extension of an X.509 certificate and extracting the Address Family Identifier (AFI). The vulnerable code blindly accesses the first two bytes of the `addressFamily->data` assuming they are valid, without checking if the `data` actually contains at least two bytes. This could lead to reading one byte past the end of the allocated buffer if the `data` array is shorter than expected, resulting in an incorrect display of the certificate's information.

The patch addresses this issue by adding a length check (`f->addressFamily->length < 2`) before accessing the `data` array. This ensures that there are enough bytes in the `data` array to safely read the two bytes needed to form the AFI. If the condition is not met, the function returns 0, effectively preventing the out-of-bounds read and mitigating the vulnerability. This fix maintains the integrity and reliability of OpenSSL's processing of X.509 certificates by ensuring that memory access operations are safely bounded within the allocated array sizes.
