Based on the description of CVE-2017-3735 and the provided patch, the root cause of this vulnerability seems to stem from an assumption in the OpenSSL code that an `IPAddressFamily` structure, specifically its `addressFamily` field, always contains at least two bytes of data. The vulnerable code attempts to construct an unsigned integer from the first two bytes of the `addressFamily` data without first verifying that this data has a sufficient length. This leads to a scenario where, if the `addressFamily` data contains fewer than two bytes, dereferencing the second byte results in a one-byte overread. This overread might seem relatively benign since it results in an "incorrect text display of the certificate," but in security-sensitive code, any kind of undefined behavior can provide an avenue for further exploitation, depending on how the affected data is used elsewhere.

The patch addresses this issue by explicitly checking that the `addressFamily` is not NULL and that its `length` is at least 2 bytes before attempting to read the data. If these conditions are not met, the function now returns `0`, avoiding the out-of-bounds read. This fix ensures that the function behaves safely by not attempting to access data beyond the bounds of the `addressFamily->data` array, thus preventing the previously described undefined behavior.

To summarize, the root cause of CVE-2017-3735 is a lack of adequate validation of the size of an `IPAddressFamily` structure's `addressFamily` data before attempting to read from it, which could lead to a one-byte overread. The patch corrects this by adding the necessary checks to prevent out-of-bounds access.
