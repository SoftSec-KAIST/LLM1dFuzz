The root cause of CVE-2017-3735 in OpenSSL involves an out-of-bounds read vulnerability related to how an IPAddressFamily extension in an X.509 certificate is parsed. Specifically, the vulnerability arises due to the code not properly checking that the `addressFamily` structure contains enough data before attempting to read two bytes from its `data` field to construct an address family identifier. 

In the original code before the patch, there was an assumption that the `addressFamily` and its `data` field were not NULL and contained the necessary bytes. However, there was no explicit check to ensure that the `data` field was at least 2 bytes long, which is required for generating the address family identifier. Consequently, if a certificate contained an IPAddressFamily extension with an `addressFamily` less than 2 bytes long, reading the second byte would lead to a one-byte overread, accessing memory beyond the intended limit. This could potentially lead to incorrect text display of the certificate or other unintended behavior due to processing this out-of-bounds data.

The patch addresses this vulnerability by explicitly adding a check that the `addressFamily`'s `length` is at least 2 before attempting to read the two bytes from its `data` field. If this condition is not met, the function returns 0, safely avoiding the out-of-bounds read. By doing so, OpenSSL ensures that it only attempts to construct the address family identifier when there is sufficient data, thus preventing the vulnerability from being exploited.
