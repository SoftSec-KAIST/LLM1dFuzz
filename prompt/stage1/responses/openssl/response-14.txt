The root cause of CVE-2017-3735 appears to stem from an insufficient validation of an X.509 certificate's IPAddressFamily extension length before reading its address family data. Specifically, the problem was a one-byte overread scenario.

In the original code, there's an assumption that the `f->addressFamily` and `f->addressFamily->data` are not NULL, and it directly proceeds to read two bytes from `data` to determine the address family identifier (AFI). However, it doesn't check if `f->addressFamily->data` actually contains at least two bytes before performing this operation. This oversight means if `f->addressFamily->data` were to contain fewer than two bytes, the code would read beyond the allocated memory for `f->addressFamily->data`, leading to an out-of-bounds read. Such behavior could potentially result in incorrect text display of the certificate or, in worse case scenarios, lead to more severe vulnerabilities like information leakage or denial of service (DoS) due to process crash.

The patch addresses this issue by adding a precondition check ensuring that `f->addressFamily->length` is at least 2, preventing the out-of-bounds read by returning 0 when the precondition is not met. This fix ensures that the software only attempts to read the two bytes for the AFI if there are indeed at least two bytes present to read, thus avoiding the risk of accessing memory beyond the intended buffer.

In summary, the root cause was the lack of proper input validation (specifically, ensuring adequate length) before accessing memory based on untrusted input (in this case, data from an X.509 certificate). The solution was to strengthen input validation by checking the length of the data buffer before performing read operations on it.
